Janet started making websites as soon as we got a stable internet connection in the household. She used it as a medium to express herself in various ways. She particularly enjoyed making satirical websites or writing satirical pieces. Janet had a very quirky, creative mind and enjoyed writing very much.

Major thank you goes to her high school friend, Tausif, who 10 years ago searched through the internet archives and managed to pull together a collection of the websites Janet made.

Of special note is Janet's version of the popular Mr. Men books many of us grew up with. She created a version called <a href="versionretro.goneretro.com/hungry/index.html">Mr Hungry</a> in her senior year of high school for her creative writing class. This was printed and distributed at her funeral in book form.
