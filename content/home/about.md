Janet Chuk Pui Law-Yip passed away peacefully on November 29th, 2006 at Kingston General Hospital with her family by her side. She had fought a short yet difficult battle against acute promyelocytic leukemia.

At the time of her passing, Janet was in the legal process of changing her last name to Law-Yip. She had big plans for post-graduation and wanted to honour her mother's maiden name with all the accomplishments she would have surely had. Her application was never finished. The family feels it is appropriate to refer to her by the name she wished to have.
