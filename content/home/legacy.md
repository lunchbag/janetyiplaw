The <b>Janet Yip-Law Memorial Award in Engineering</b> for the University of Waterloo is made possible by donations from family and friends of Janet Chuk Pui Yip-Law.

Janet received her Bachelors of Applied Sciences in Electrical Engineering, class of 2007. In her final two years, she was elected as Engineering Councillor to represent the interests of the student body in the Federation of Students (FEDS). In addition, she volunteered her time to the local community as an active member of the Waterloo Public Interest Research Group (WPIRG) and founder of a peace activist group on campus. This award is presented in memory of Janetâ€™s iron will as well as her impact on the individuals and communities she encountered in her short yet inspiring life.
