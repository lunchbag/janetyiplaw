The <b>Janet Law-Yip Memorial Award in Engineering</b> for the University of Waterloo is made possible by donations from family and friends of Janet Chuk Pui Law-Yip.

Janet received her Bachelors of Applied Sciences in Electrical Engineering posthumously, class of 2007. In her final two years, she was elected as Engineering Councillor to represent the interests of the student body in the Federation of Students (FEDS). In addition, she was an active member of the Waterloo Public Interest Research Group (WPIRG) where her involvement ranged from delivering bread for Food Not Bombs to working with neighbouring Laurier students on anti-war initiatives.
