        No relationship will draw more immediate disapproval from strangers than when a rich old man and a young beautiful woman get married. The final no-appeal, no-bail verdict is that the woman is after money, and the man is after status or sex,
        (because that's exactly what men with vast empires and aging libidos need.) This is understandable when the man is somebody like Hugh Hefner. But what about when it's an ex-Beatle in his early sixties who marries a former model in her mid
        thirties? Maybe a little scandalous, but not if the Beatle is Paul McCartney.
        <P>
          Heather Mills didn't do it for the money. How do I know this? Because Paul McCartney is a kindhearted man. He is a vegetarian. He is a humble man. Certainly more humble than most UW engineers. When he sees a chicken or a pig, he sees 'a
          little friend', and so he can't eat it. That's very sweet, isn't it?
          <P>
            Did you think that was sarcastic? If so, you're a fucking savage. Really. I mean, why is compassion for animals such an absurd idea? I'll go even farther and say this is mostly a Western thing. The Eastern nations can be forgiven because
            they have traditionally been too poor to worry about animals, but Westerners have been settled comfortably for generations now! Hardly anybody (white) who grew up in Canada had to worry about starvation and poverty. And yet, take a look
            at a chicken barn. I think it means something when an engineering assignment to design a chicken barn involves trying to pack as many cells as possible as tightly as you can in a given volume.
            <P>
              Perhaps this has something to do with the Christian notion that animals are for our use. I'm sorry, I thought it was a compassionate religion? Yes, Christ encouraged his followers to take good care of their livestock, but that was
              entirely for their own selfish gains. How can you have compassion for your fellow man when you don't see the need to have compassion for an animal? One who thinks that an animal is there for them to use would have no problem using
              other human beings as they see fit.
              <P>
                This sometimes leads me to the thought that maybe there is something very selfish about the West. There's some stupid new-age thing going on now, where punk rock kids claim to worship the Earth as Pagans and big Hollywood stars make
                a big deal of converting to Zen Buddhism. This is all a load of shit. In fact, if you come across a Zen Buddhist, know that they are full of shit (or at least probably so.) Zen riddles sure sound cool, but the core of Zen is so
                abstract, it's hard to believe the hippies of the sixties actually accomplished anything besides fuck around with what the Buddha said and eat organic yogurt. Do you really need to call yourself 'Zen'? What is the difference between
                a moral system based on compassion and a trendy Buddhist tag you can show off?
                <P>
                  But it's not all lost. Compassion DOES have a presence, even in Waterloo. You know, there are kids who gather every Saturday to cook and serve free vegan meals in front of Kitchener City Hall. Is it the work of the polished giant
                  EngSoc? No, those self-absorbed EngSoc kids are too busy feeling good about themselves. The group responsible is actually 'Food Not Bombs', a dippy little subgroup of WPIRG.

                    What?? Who the fuck are they?
