It is a pretty well known fact that America is the fattest country in the
world.  However, I had passed it off as a silly statistic; that most
Western developed countries had about the same obesity rate and America's
happened to be at the top of the caramel roasted peanut cluster.
<P>
So I never thought much of it until I visited the Detroit Zoo this year on
Easter weekend.  This was only my second significant trek into the States,
and the difference hit me like a sweaty bacon truck driven by a large
bulging man.  The people I saw were fat.  Lots of people were fat.  And I
don't mean phat with a 'p-h'.  I mean fat to the power of 'n', where n is a
fat stick of warm butter.
<P>
Granted they were mostly families that I saw, but you can try the Pepsi
Challenge: Take a sample of some Detroiters in one hand, another sample of
the same group from Windsor in the other hand, bring your hands behind your
back and switch them around a bit, hold out your hands again, and anybody
will be able to immediately tell you which hand holds the fatter people.
Even if you wipe off all the telltale grease that'll be dripping from the
correct hand.  They'll still be able to tell.
<P>
Walking around the zoo proved to be quite interesting.  Almost all the
women were grouchy looking.  Many of them sneered at the lovely sunny sky
like it was steamed tofu on wild rice.  I saw one woman who wasn't
overweight, and she seemed like a 20-year-old virgin beauty queen in a
field of ham.  Many men were fat as well, and those who weren't looked like
Kid Rock.  Maybe that made sense.
<P>
It also made sense that Krispy Kreme Donuts were there for a promotion.
Now, it's been said that the sugar in one Krispy Kreme donut is equivalent
to the total sugar in giving each person in seven households of seven
people seven boxes of seven regular donuts.  And you might want to multiply
that by seven once more, just for the hell of it.
<P>
With this in mind, it seemed to make complete sense that they were there
giving out free donuts, and I saw the long line-up of people at the booth.
Because the line was so long, you might think that it would look a little
stretched and so maybe a bit thinner, but no, it was still a pretty fat
line.  I guess it made the most sense when I got closer and learned that
the line-up wasn't actually to get the donuts.  That line was quite short.
The long line was for the people who wanted to dip their donuts into a vat
of bubbling chocolate oil.
