I work at a huge HMV store, and we've got our own dance room, which is basically a room that's closed off from the rest of the store where we keep the urban music. 'Urban music' means dance, reggae, hip-hop, electronica, and other stuff that we think might scare all the grandmothers who might wander in. 
<p>
In the store, we have strict playlists.  We can't play weird obscure music on the speakers, only really popular and new promotional releases.  However, our manager is afraid of the dance room, so whoever's working there can play whatever they want.
<p>
I didn't mind my dance room shifts, except I had to work frequently with this guy Kenny*.
<p>
See, Kenny would always bring in this cd of his brother's music to play in the dance room.  Not that his brother's a professional dj.  By far no.  His brother's one of those 'independent' dj's who sits at his computer in his basement, presses a few buttons, and burns a cd-r of the shittiest amateurish crap you can imagine.
<p>

Kenny called them 'beats'.
<p>
Now, it's understandable to want to promote your own stuff in the store you work at, even if you're not supposed to, but Kenny was just a moron. From time to time, customers would kinda look up, listen, and ask him what it was that was playing.  And Kenny would tell them that it was his brother's music.  Most of the time, they'd say "oh" and walk away disinterested.  But sometimes they'd inquire further about it, asking if there was a way to get ahold of some more of his brother's stuff.
<p>
At this time, Kenny would say "no" and stare back blankly.
<p>
I hated his music but I'd try to be nice, so once, I suggested that his brother make his music available, or at least have Kenny give out his business cards when people ask.  But Kenny said no.
<p>
So that was bad enough.  But then it got worse.
<p>
One day, I wanted to hear some new dance compilation cd.  Proper etiquette is that we all have some say in what we play, so I put in my dance cd, with Kenny's shitty beats cd, with some others, and put it on random-play mode.  It starts playing, and Kenny makes a mad dash for the CD-player like I had set his child on fire.
<p>
"NO!  We have to play this cd. We can play your dance cd later!" he says.  I protested: "But we can just put it on random.  Then we'll both hear what we want to hear."  Then he gave me his explanation:
<p>
"No.  It CAN'T be on random.  We have to play THIS Busta Rhymes cd STRAIGHT.  And THEN right after, we play MY cd.  That way, people will think it's BUSTA RHYMES they're hearing, and they'll like it and ask me about it.  Cuz if they know right away that its some small artist, they lose interest."
<p>
So that was pretty bad. It was funny though, but after a while, it spiralled downward so that it wasn't funny anymore but still bad.  He'd put in ONLY his cd, and put the Busta Rhymes cd case on the counter so it looked like Busta Rhymes was playing.  He told whoever was working with him that if the manager walks by and inquires about the music, to "tell him it's an interlude on the Busta Rhymes cd".

<p>
That was a few months ago, and recently I was working with him and things haven't changed.  He's lost a bit of that early enthusiasm but still clings on to his crappy music.  When a customer asks what it is, he'd stare at them, then with a nod of his head say abruptly "you like it?".  And then just as abruptly: "it's my brother's stuff.  He makes beats."
<p>
The other day, Dylan was working with him and Kenny went to go on his break or something but left the music playing.  As he walked out, he called behind his shoulder to Dylan: "If our manager asks what's playing, tell him it's this!" and threw a Cam'ron cd at him.  The Cam'ron cd was still sealed.
<p>
So it looks like he's losing his guard.  We hope he gets fired soon.  He's so shitty, like his music.
