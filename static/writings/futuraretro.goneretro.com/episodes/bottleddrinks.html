One time last year, Darren* and I were at Shoppers Drug Mart, and he wanted a drink. He decided to get one of those queer $3 drinks in colored themed bottles. He picked a Pina Colada drink. 
<p>
Now, I don't like coconut, so I tried to discourage him with the very weak claim that it probably had alcohol in it. He said that he didn't think so. 
<p>
We walked around for a bit, and when we were in the checkout line, I noticed that he had switched his drink to some weird fruit punch thing. I asked him his reason for the change. 
<p>
"You were right, it DID have alcohol in it." he said. 
<p>

"What?? How do you know?" I asked. 
<p>
"It said on the bottle. 'Sand's Alcohol'."
