 <td valign=top align=right width=30%>Comments:</td><td>Hey Janet, saw your site in your ICQ info (for some reason, I check ppl's info when I'm reeeaaally bored / procrastinating)
<br>
<br>Your site is an impressive piece of work, if I may say.  Many of the things you've got on here are things I've thought of for my website, but I had no time / was too lazy / procrastinated from doing it.
<br>
<br>Interesting essay about terrorism, although I don't agree with your take on it.. 
<br>
<br>And I think, if/when you update your site next, you tell the story of the concert you attended @ Waterloo (you know the one.. we talked about on ICQ.. I won't say any details, in case.. in retrospect you're embarassed by it :->)
<br>
<br>Hmm.. and that robotics class joke thing sounds like something I would do (intentionally of course.. I never do stupid things.  Never.)  But since I wasn't in your class, I guess I'm safe.. 
<br>
<br>Anyhoo, look me up next time you're back in Markham.
<br>
<br>Adam
<br>
<br>And BTW: MP3 files are great :p</td>

<br>written by myself that i just rediscovered on Imaginary 
<br>Lovers Anonymous, but DAMN, i was either really drunk off 
<br>my ass or in one of those half asleep half awake-and-
<br>BRILLIANT states when i thought up that ostentatious peice 
<br>of work. Either way i just laughed myself silly after

<br>Any way, here it is
<br>
<br>BEGIN ILA EXCERPT
<br>
<br>Dear ILA, 
<br>After reading all the other posts, I feel I need to admit 
<br>that I had an imaginary lover once too. Or so I thought... 
<br>After the sex and after the drunkeness went away that one 
<br>night, I realized that my lover was indeed not imaginary, 
<br>but real. But I also realized that it was not a person, but 
<br>an exhaust pipe... 
<br>- Bill C 
<br>
<br>Ai-yahhh! 
<br>- Sheetal and Shirlia 
<br>
<br>END ILA EXCERPT
<br>
<br>Now go visit ILA at http://members.nbci.com/ilanonymous/ 
<br>because its a fun site that hasn't been updated in more 
<br>than a year! WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
<br>
<br>OH! About the weeeeeeee... Janet already knows, but if you 
<br>don't, go here http://www.threebrain.com/weeeeee.html
<br>(unfortunately the site seems to be down... ohwell, you 
<br>should try anyway)</td>

<br>and, if in any case I do, it means in a drunken haze of 
<br>glory I mashed my fist into the "radio" button instead 
<br>of "cd". I listen to underground. I don't listen to the 
<br>bullshit that comes on the radio. Like lo fedelity, or 
<br>moby, or dave matthews. sorry. And I don't ever, EVER 
<br>listen to teckno. Because of one simple reason. It's shit. 
<br>I liten to scant cd's. and if I do, you won't understand 
<br>what they're saying over the screaming. I'm into film. 
<br>Janets reviews are for the msot part fair enough. altho 
<br>they seem to be deemed for the masses alone. not for any 
<br>rather quality consumption. sorry, just creative critisizm.

<br>they are about as un-rapperish as they come. Listen buddy, 
<br>Janet's tastes are about 15 years ahead of yours. In 5-10 
<br>years when Techno is the rage and everyone listens to 
<br>electronica (You will too because its "cool" and Janet will 
<br>like something newer and more hip that will not be as "cool" 
<br>as what you like). I'm sick of posers that like top40 radio 
<br>stations. I'm sick of bands that are played on top40 
<br>stations. I love creativity, classical music, Dave matthews 
<br>band, MOBY, Lo-Fidelity all stars.. As far as I'm concerned 
<br>you can take your poser status and shove it up your tight

<br>like, because they're heavily influenced by rap and such, 
<br>in fact, on the third Korn CD, EVERY guest is a rapper.
<br>
<br>hah you lose Janet, no hardcore for you.
<br>
<br>either way, this site is a bit to organized for my tastes, 
<br>it seems it was constructed totally on the basis that 
<br>insane personal philosophy (and smoker bashing, screw you) 
<br>is the most organized of philosophys, and must, therefore, 
<br>be read. 
<br>
<br>Oh man. that can't be good for my site. Which is entitled 
<br>"JANET: THE NEXT GENERATION OF PAIN"
<br>BTW, Garbage are POP, not rock. 
<br>
<br>YOU LOSE! rock has to cross a certain hardcore boundary 
<br>before it becomes rock in my books. SOrry.
<br>I love being a rocker.
