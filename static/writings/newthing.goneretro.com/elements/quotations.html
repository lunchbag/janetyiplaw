"... you see, I drive a taxi..."
<BR><I>Imagined overheard conversation between two taxicab drivers at taxicab boulevard outside Finch Station (08/03/02)</I>
<P>
"Yo, where's my Big Mac, y'all?"
<BR><I>Overheard at the most depressed McDonald's ever (at Spadina and Queen) (08/03/02)</I>
<P>
"So India and Pakistan are going to war.  To most people, it'll just be the same country fighting itself."
<BR><I>-- Dylan (06/05/02)</I>
<P>
"Lincoln Day? Who's Lincoln Day and why is he taking over Chinese New Year?"
<BR><I>-- Michael (02/12/02)</I>
<P>
"Being John Malkovich?? This is just a cheap ripoff of Erin Brockovich!"
<BR><I>-- Jennifer (02/09/02)</I>
<P>
"Why are you taking politics?  Are you going to be a policeman?"
<BR><I>-- Anjo (01/29/02)</I>
<P>
"Communism in the Soviet Union?  All I know is that they better stop Stalin' and start Russian'!"
<BR><I>-- Dylan (01/30/02)</I>
<P>
"The United States army used infrared sensors on the Iraqi's during the Gulf War. They'd have them on their planes, and bomb them during nighttime when no one could see anything. However, the trouble with infrared sensors is that they detect heat, but otherwise, really can't identify an object. (dramatic regretful sigh) The Iraqi's lost forty thousand sheep in that war."
<BR><I>-- Khouri (01/22/02)</I>
<P>
"I used to think some of my dreams were visions of passed lives. I remember one in particular in great detail. I was a courageous knight on a beautiful white horse, running in some battle.  It was a dreary rainy England-type day with a horribly dull-gray sky, in a wet green fielded area, and after a few seconds, I saw this blade come through one of my helmet's eye slits. And that was the end of the dream."
<BR><I>-- Ian (02/01/02)</I>
<P>
(After many earnest but failed attempts by me to locate a rap CD in the store)
"Why don't you ask that guy over there? He might know. (pointing to the only black employee in the room)"
<BR><I>-- A customer (02/02/02)</I>
<P>
"... You know, it's like that law where three objects can't occupy the same space at the same time." 
<BR><I>-- Dylan (11/03/01) </I>
<P>
"Aww... it's like that gay thing people do!" 
<BR><I>-- Kai, after exchanging a more-than-queer thumbs-up with Dylan (10/30/01) </I>
<P>
"There was this guy in Alaska who got drunk and shot at some oil pipes, and everyone thought it was the terrorists, but they stopped caring when they realized it wasn't. Well, I'm sure the little baby seal, covered in oil, didn't care if it was Bin Laden or Been Drinking." 
<BR><I>-- Mullen (10/18/01) </I>
<P>
"I learned in grade ten that the Germans hated the Jews because they didn't go to war... what, no?? Oh... well, it was a Tamil school." 
<BR><I>-- This brown guy in history class (10/18/01) </I>
<P>

<BR><I>-- Some brown guy on Dylan's bus (10/05/01)</I>
<P>
"If you eat yogurt and then drink milk, you'll die."
<BR><I>-- Pradeep's grandmother (09/17/01)</I>
<P>
"There's this guy at the Ex who sells chiropractic shoes. But the important thing is he looks like Archie Andrews." 
<BR><I>-- Vick (08/31/01) </I>
<P>
"No, you have to spell 'LAN' with capital letters. Otherwise, you get my name." 
<BR><I>-- Ian (sometime in 2000)</I>
