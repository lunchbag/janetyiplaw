The main purpose behind all my website projects is to give myself an opportunity to write. Though most of my writing's mundane and horribly ignorant and biased... well whatever. The point is, if there's any meat, it'd be here, where all my subjective editorials and commentaries are located.

<BR><i>(02/24/02)</i>

Here is another essay I wrote, originally for school, but is now published here. This is an issue I feel very passionate about, and perhaps if someone important enough read it, international disaster can be avoided. 
<P>
Or maybe the US government will simply confiscate me. There's nothing I can do about that, so I may as well use my voice while I still have it.

<BR><i>(01/15/02)</i>
<BR>
This was actually an essay I wrote for my 20th Century World History class, but it was a topic of great interest and I had a lot of fun reading it. Since it wasn't for a university class, the material still belongs to me so I figured I'll post it here.
