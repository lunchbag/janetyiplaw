One time in English class, our teacher McGann was talking about volunteerism. She said that if you volunteer but then you tell everyone about it, then it doesn't really count because you were just doing the favour to look good. However, people who volunteer, but don't tell anyone about what they did, are truly saints. 
<P>
So then, this girl Shelly spoke up. "Yeah, like me!" 
<P>
I think Tausif and I were the only ones who laughed, probably because no one else was paying attention. McGann got this look on her face, like she was weird-funny (not funny-funny) amused by something but she was trying to hide it. "Umm... but you just said..." 
<P>
Shelly was listening attentively to what she had to say, so McGann must have assumed that she didn't quite understand. So she repeated "No, when you volunteer, you're not supposed to tell anyone..." 
<P>
Shelly looked like McGann had just said something stupidly obvious, cuz then she said, in this voice like she was saying something stupidly obvious: "Yeah, that's what I do!" 
<P>
McGann then just shook her head and shrugged "Alright..." and English class continued and the topic was never brought up again.
