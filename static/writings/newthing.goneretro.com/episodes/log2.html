Ooooh, the school play was Tuesday and Wednesday (June 25, 26).  I can honestly and humbly say that my scene went very well and was considered the best one by a number of people.  I had a lot of fun performing it, and felt like a star because the next few days, many people were stopping me in the halls to tell me how much they laughed.  Truth be told though, it isn't that I am exceptional, it was simply because I played a child and so I got to act out a lot of emotions and actions.  Whereas most of the other actors played normal people; some had weird stories, but they were essentially normal people that did not require too much acting.
<P>
We had originally thought that Tuesday would be a very quiet evening because of the hockey game and night school classes that would be taking place that night.  However, our directing teacher got a few night school classes to attend the show so we had a much bigger audience than we expected.  It was also a tougher audience because people who take night school are drug-dealing drop-outs.
<P>
As it turned out, it WAS a somewhat tough audience as the actors who were in the first few scenes reported that there was not much laughter even at the most comedic moments.  Keeping this in mind, I was determined to draw some laughter so I really pushed myself when it was time for our scene.
<P>
Now, it is quite something to "push" yourself when you are presenting something.  It actually feels like a physical struggle.  I was not nervous at all, but with each burst of excited dialogue and child-like jumpiness, I felt like I was heaving my body against a boulder that I was trying to push.
<P>
It was a wonderful feeling.  But then, success usually feels wonderful.
<P>
So that was Tuesday, on the next night, it was a much easier crowd, as expected since the audience was mostly made up of personal friends and family.  The actors who went before me all experienced that wonderful feeling of success because of the laughs they got, especially since they had been a bit disappointed at the lack of response on Tuesday.
<P>
Then it was my turn again, and I once again pushed myself, though this time my motive was that I wanted to impress the people who knew me in the audience.  (I am VERY vain.)  I thought the amount of laughter was about the same, though maybe it was because we got a lot of it on Tuesday.  (I am VERy arrogant.)  Afterward, during the intermission, a fellow-actor told me that her 8-year-old cousin was in the audience, and he is usually very stubborn and rude but even he thought "that girl with the pink hair" was hilarious.  I felt very pleased.  I love being approved by kids.
<P>
The show went on, and during the second-last show, the fire alarm went off.  There was a lot of confusion.  There were about 5 actors on stage, and the rest of us performers were hiding in a classroom when it happened.  Many of my fellow actors got pissed off and started swearing at the jerk who pulled the alarm.  I thought it was kind of funny and really added colour to the evening.
<P>
I thought it was even funnier when I found out later what was going on on stage.  The alarm went and the actors on stage stopped for a bit in surprise.  Then, the audience was wondering what was going on.  Then, the actors decided to keep going with it, so they resumed their scene, but talked louder.  And they just kept saying their lines louder and louder until after a whole two minutes, our teacher finally went on stage and told them to stop.
<P>
Everybody evacuated the building and I think we lost a large part of our audience.  We waited around in the parking lot and were talking of continuing the scene outside until we all silently agreed that it would be a stupid idea.  (We silently agreed by not doing it.)  Anyway, we spent about 15 minutes outside, and the entire cast even had a picture taken with a firefighter in front of the firetruck.
<P>
Finally we went back inside, and I reassured the actors whose scene got interrupted that the audience would be especially kind.  Sure enough, they got extra applause when they started up again.
<P>
In fact, everybody was in extra-high spirits for the rest of the evening.  The last scene and the thank-you's at the end were full of cheesy fire jokes, which were greeted with roaring laughter.  I guess it's the bond people feel when they are all subjected to the same catastrophe.

I only recently decided on a university to go to next year, and about two nights ago, I started my online application for government funding.  It was an extremely confusing process, with many unclear questions that asked for information I had not yet received.  After a night's frustration, I finally closed my eyes and went ahead with it, e-mailing it yesterday.
<P>
Today, I came home to find four emails in answer to some I had sent two nights ago.  I did not think that I would get a reply because of the automated-message I got explaining that they were being swamped with questions.  Anyways, it turned out that I had made some very significant errors.
<P>
So now, I am sitting here having just finished the letter that I will have to mail by post to the school.  Unfortunately for me, a sum of money is at stake.
<P>
It's bad enough that they make kids choose what they want to be for the rest of their lives when they're 18 or 19.  But do they have to make it this easy to trip up?
<P>
I am proud that I managed to sit down for so long though.  Quite a few times, I longed to open Minesweeper or Spider Solitaire to relieve some of the stress, (to say that I am addicted would be to state the obvious,) but I recently removed the Games folder from my Windows XP account.  That's right, I'm trying to kick the habit, because it's taking up way too much of my time.  It was getting really ridiculous, where literally 80%+ of my computer time is wasted.
<P>
I got through about a day on that route.  Then, the need to sweep mines became too much for me, so I went on the internet and found a really crappy java version (I would post the url but then it would be too easy for me to visit every time I review my site.)  I refused to bookmark the site, knowing what it would lead to, but I did memorize how to get to it (Go to Yahoo!, search for 'Minesweeper', click on 'Web Games - Minesweeper', click on '@Java', select 'JavaSweeper'.)
<P>
There is no fix for getting a mine on the first click and at times it may freeze up a bit.  Worse, the numbers are really hard to make out and I find myself straining to read it as my face is scrunched up three inches from the monitor, whose glow on my skin only adds to my zombie state.
<P>
However, I have managed to cut down considerably (only 25% of my time wasted, gold star!)  Of course, I then explored Shockwave.com's game-filled site and spent the last two hours of my awakened mode yesterday doing shockwave jigsaw puzzles.  These puzzles are really starting to piss me off because the pieces' sides aren't precise enough and their pictures are kind of blurred so it's hard to judge which pieces go together.
<P>
I guess I'm one of those jigsaw puzzle geeks.  I really love putting them together, but I don't know what to do with them when I'm done.  All the fun's gone, and I detest the idea of displaying them, so I usually break it up again and put it in the box and go back to it only after a few years when hopefully my mind has erased all memory of it.  But that kind of sucks and it seems silly to pile up boxes of puzzles.  So I simply don't buy them and am constantly thirsting for it.
<P>
Today, I was getting ready for my shower and decided to cut my hair.  I took about five inches off (why do I think in inches??) so now it's just past my shoulders.  I used an ordinary pair of scissors and made it look really choppy.  At the back, it's a bit longer because it was more difficult to reach.  I think it looks really good, especially with the tint.  Of course, it looks very homemade and most people would probably think it ugly, especially this girl I saw today.
<P>
Let me tell you about this girl.  We were going to a job fair in our school gym (basically just the co-op students making sorry attempts at sharing their experiences via a bristol board,) and there was this one really pretty girl who was a hairstylist for her co-op term, (this is the aforementioned disapproving girl.)  What was interesting was that in one of the pictures on her board, she was working with someone's head of hair and she had this disgusted look on her face like she was being forced to reach into a toilet to retrieve some dead animal that was clogging the drain.
<P>
We went to this job fair during first period, which is my senior Writer's Craft class.  I'm not sure why we went because we're all senior students and most of us are graduating this month.  I guess my teacher was just being nice when she received the memo from the co-op department.  By the way, in that class right now, we're supposed to be doing a children's book.  It's due in two days and I haven't started but I've got a pretty fun idea, though it is probably very inappropriate for the genre.  Maybe I'll scan it and post it when I'm done.
<P>
IF I'm done.  I guess I don't really care anymore because I have to fall to 70% before my university withdraws their offer, and since I only have English OAC left to complete, and have gone through maybe 75% of the course, there is NO WAY it can go wrong.
<P>
Of course, that's what the guy said before the piano dropped on to his head.

Well, today was my English presentation for Robertson Davies' <I>Fifth Business</I>.  our group was doing the topic of Saints, Myth and Magic and it was actually very interesting and the process may have been fun if certain members of our group had been a bit more co-operative... In the end, we had a bit of time left so I did a magic trick.  I only know one: the castle / bandits trick, and I thought it was going pretty well until of the three jacks I was supposed to pull out, I only produced two.  For some reason, the two of diamonds turned up.  I wasn't sure what went on, so I gave them that old line about how "two outta three ain't bad". My English teacher sympathized with me and got everybody to clap.
<P>
I have a ridiculous number of projects to start and finish.  I have to write a memoire for English due tomorrow, which I just finished as half-assed as it is.  I also have to do that children's book and ISU project for Writer's Craft -
<P>
- Well, the phone just rang.  It's 11:18 PM on a Tuesday night so I picked up quickly, knowing that it's a relative from Hong Kong.  I say "hello?".  A curt voice that sounds like it belongs to a 50-year-old woman says in Chinese my mother's name.  As in "Susanna."  Nothing else.  Imagine if everybody did that on the phone.  People would get annoyed so easily if they knew it wasn't someone important on the other end (like their relative from Hong Kong,) or maybe everybody would be used to it and we'd be walking around talking curtly and think nothing of it.  I'm not sure if that's how people converse on the phone in Hong Kong, but in any case, every caller from overseas has always done this.
<P>
Hmmm... I'm not going to finish that thought I started before the phone rang, but I will reveal that I have been playing Minesweeper.  May I add, Windows XP Minesweeper.  That's right, but no, I have NOT added it to my start menu again.  Instead, I go through 'Explore All Users' and find the shortcut in my family's XP account that leads to Minesweeper.  Same goes for Spider Solitaire.  Yeah, I've just started that about an hour ago.  Same principle really, I want to feed my habit a bit, but I won't make it easily accessible.  It'll be fine.
<P>
Of course, that's what the guy said before the piano dropped on to his head.
<P>
Looks like that silly phrase is becoming a motto.  That reminds me, last Thursday, I was leading a group of Grade 8 students around our school (they enter high school next year.)  I was with Andrew (the white guy,) and Yvette (Sylvia's sister,) and we were to lead a group of about 15 students.  I kept emphasizing that they needn't be afraid of the senior students because any unpleasant initiation they may get would only come from their own older brothers and sisters.  I told them that during our tour, if anybody harassed them, to holler my name (I had a "HELLO MY NAME IS <U><I>janet</I></U>" nametag) and I would deal with it.  A kid asked me if I would kick their ass, and I told them that I would probably start swearing at them and make a scene.  That seemed to satisfy him.  I also told them to not get lost, telling them that "if you get lost while following three people, then you have problems."  I repeated that at least four times in the half-hour our tour lasted.
<P>
Well I don't think I'm going to finish any of that work I was talking about.  Bumps have appeared on my right middle finger and they're really itchy.  It happens from time to time and it really makes me suffer.  I think it may be a food allergy, though I'm not sure what I could be allergic to.  Today, I ate tofu, fried tofu, beef, cauliflower and some Chinese vegetables.  I knawed on a smoked turkey bone in the afternoon.  At lunch I had some vietnamese noodles with beef, tripe and bean sprouts.  It may be beef, cuz my parents tell me that beef is a common allergy item.  I hope not because I'm going to keep eating it.  I like the taste of cows.
<P>
Or maybe I've got herpes or some weird venereal disease on my finger.  I don't think so because I don't remember using my finger for that.
<P>
Christ, it itches like a beeeeech though.

I just got home from work, and have to finish up some work for school before I go to sleep so I can go to work again tomorrow, albeit at a different job.  My throat feels horrible, it hurts and my mouth feels parched like I'm terribly thirsty but the feeling won't go away no matter how much I drink.  It was really bad last night, and I had to get up a few times to drink some water, and I even started talking in my sleep about my thirst ("I'm pretty thirsty, I'd sure like some water" in that strange melodic sleep-talking voice.)  Needful to say, it was very creepy.
<P>
On Thursday night, I finished my children's book for my Writer's Craft class, and on Friday morning, I scanned all of the pages.  As soon as I fix the images so that it's appropriate for web-downloading and web-viewing, I will post it.  It's marvellous.
<P>
I am also very proud to say that Ian got a better job.  Before, he had a really crappy job selling knives.  It was one of those Avon-type jobs - but with knives of course.  Anyway, I told him that he should call up a tech company that hires high school students for co-operative education programs and ask for a job, (especially after a teacher told him to.)  Ian said "Yeah I guess I SHOULD..." but of course he didn't.  So I forced him to write up a resume in about an hour, and then walked him to a phone booth at lunch the next day and told him to not start eating until he had made the call.
<P>
Well, a week or so later, he got a call from the company asking for an interview.  He went the next day and was hired.  He seems quite happy, and now he owes me dinner.
<P>
This proves that everybody should listen to me <U>for their own good</U>.
<P>
Well my throat hurts and I haven't done much on this work.  Good-bye.

Well, that bad throat made me sick all weekend.  Yesterday morning, I felt very faint but still got myself up to go to work for seven hours.  I was very shaky the whole day, and tried to take it easy by sitting around not helping customers.  I guess that's not really something to be ashamed of since it's what 80% of our employees do every day.  It's a good thing my manager wasn't there.
<P>
It's 9:30 AM Monday now, and I don't think I'm going to attend any classes today.  I'll probably have to drop by to finish some work and hand some stuff in though, but then I want to come home to cook myself some pasta and watch the Beatles' "Yellow Submarine" video that Jacob lent me weeks ago.  I have a lot of stuff I want to watch but haven't found the time.  I don't know if I mentioned it, but Dylan bought me the Beatles 4-DVD box that includes the movies "Help!" and "Magical Mystery Tour", the behind-the-scenes documentary of "A Hard Day's Night", and their first US visit that includes their very famous appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show.  
I really can't wait to watch that stuff.  Mullen had shown us some clips of "Magical Mystery Tour" and it was just so trippy.  He showed us the very queer "I am the Walrus" video that included a very handsome John Lennon holding out his arms all the time and an egg.  There was also a weird dream sequence in which John was the waiter of a very heavy woman at a restaurant.  The woman ordered spaghetti and John got a wheelbarrow and started shovelling piles of spaghetti and meatballs on to her table.  The woman started crying and said it was too much and kept on eating, but John paid no attention and held a grotesquely indifferent-polite-waiter smile.
<P>
But "Magical Mystery Tour" is supposed to be kind of crappy with strange metaphors that don't metaphor to anything.  I still want to sit through it, as there is some great music from their trippy era in it.  The only full Beatles movie I had seen was "A Hard Day's Night", and I was so disappointed when I found out that it had been discontinued.
<P>
Oh I also bought the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" DVD yesterday.  I have no idea what's on it though.  The DVD was just released but the material is from the early 80's.
<P>
Hmmm... I think it's about time I upload everything and make my way to school soon.
