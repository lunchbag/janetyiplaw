Monday, July 16, 2001 was a day of lies. 
<P>
First of all, as I was playing Spider Solitaire on the computer, Ian messaged me saying that Lahan* said that she was "very good at Spider" and frequently won games at the difficult level. 
<P>
WELL 
<BR>No one is smarter than me, and I can only beat the medium level games half of the time. Therefore, Lahan is a liar. If you ever meet anyone named Lahan, they may be compulsive liars, but you would never know because the real person in this story is not named Lahan. 
<P>
Today, at Ian's house, I started playing Spider Solitaire at the medium level. After winning it on the first try, I started to brag about how I was the only one smart enough to beat Spider at the medium level. Ian then spoke up, saying that he has beaten Spider at the medium level too. 
<P>
SO 
<BR>I clicked on the Statistics tab, and it read: 
<P>
Wins: 1 
<BR>Losses: 6 
<BR>Win Rate: 14% 
<P>
Hahahha point proven. 
<P>
So Ian protested that he doesn't play on that particular computer, and so, the statistics did not reflect his victories. Ignoring his comment, I opened Minesweeper. It was set to a custom window of 30 x 24 with ten mines. I started to make fun of Ian, and again he said that he doesn't play on that particular computer and so, the settings must have been set by his brother. 
<P>
SO 
<BR>I opened Best Times, and the first two scores read "Ian". The last one read "Ina". 
<P>
Ian's rebuttal was that the scores were from a long time ago. 
<P>
Overall conclusion: if you lie, I will find you and expose you for the liar that you are! So don't lie. 
<P>
(Epilogue: Ian called the day 'a bad sequence of events'.)
