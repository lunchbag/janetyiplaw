I've decided to start a journal because I've been feeling sad.
<P>
I had a dull weekend.  I mostly worked, except on Friday, when I went to the Garbage concert.  You can read about my silly experience under 'Diversions'.  It definitely does not qualify as a review.
<P>
Then I worked worked worked...
<P>
Saturday I felt the earthquake.  I remember waking up with the word 'earthquake' flashing in my head but I thought I was dreaming... I suppose that was it, because later I heard on the radio that there was an earthquake.  It's quite a funny sensation, to have a strange idea flash suddenly in your mind, dismiss it as nonsense, and then find out that it's true when it's much too late to investigate it.
<P>
I'm still kind of upset right now... in a dull bleak way.  I bought some hair colour to cheer myself up but I was looking in the mirror and there's still some tint in it so i don't think it's time yet... While at Shoppers, I also bought some Wunderbar chocolate roll thing.  As already  mentioned, I wanted to cheer myself up, so I got candy, and since Dylan wasn't there, I got some with peanut butter.  They taste like unreasonably-crusty Rolo.
<P>
That reminds me of the time when our local BiWay (a low-class dollar-store type place) was closing down, and I wanted to take advantage of the stuff they'd be trying to get rid of at below rock-bottom prices.  However, I did not feel the need for cheap shoes or clothes or cassette tapes of Bob Mahooney's gee-tar work, nor did I trust their cheap soaps or beauty products.  However, I did decide that I would buy some cheap candy bars, since even BiWay carries candy of recognizable brands (ie Nestle, Cadbury, etc...) and so technically, it should be the same as if I were to buy it at President Bush's own vending machine.  So Jane and I went there and bought some chocolate bars, and as I was chewing on mine, she remarked that the candy was stale.  Well, even if I had noticed, I wouldn't have cared because I'm a savage and savages will eat anything.

A month later and I wonder if this can be called a log.  It seems I don't know the meaning of a log, but then again, from the looks of it, I seem to get confused by the concepts of 'reviews', 'editorials', 'stories', and 'goddamnit janet, what is all this crap?'.
<P>
I've been quite busy with my drama play rehearsals.  I've had to stay at school most days after school for an uncomfortable amount of time.  The play is this coming Tuesday and Wednesday and we haven't even gone through our entire scene before the directors yet (Each scene is a separate story and stars 2-3 people.)
<P>
I'm also trying to juggle two part-time jobs while remaining a full-time student.  My work is quite tiring, but offers me variety and a lot of fun, (I'm a waitress and music/video salesperson.)  The pay is horrid (no tips or commission,) but I love both of my jobs and perhaps never realized how lucky I am until recently when a good friend of mine acquired a more than questionable job as one of those door-to-door salespeople, very similar to those Avon ladies.
<P>
But, now that my final high school marks are in, I can kind of relax and not be too stressed out in terms of school.  You know how most graduates-to-be tend to not care too much about their work or what their teachers think of them because it's near the end?  Well I've found that I've been quite rude to a lot of people in my school, not teachers but my peers.  I think I'm taking out all the frustration and disgust I've felt for them all these years, because high school is actually quite the camp for jackasses.  BUT I've gotten a bit carried away and probably told off some people that didn't deserve it, and for that reason, I do feel sorry.
<P>
Of course, even if everyone was as horrid as I think they are, it still does not give me the right to appoint myself the judge and jury.  However, it's graduation revenge and slightly-late-adolescent angst, and I'd do most of it again if I could go back.

On Friday at school, I was stepping out of class for a short bit, and was pleasantly surprised to hear the sound of "Turn Turn Turn" by the Byrds coming from the school atrium.  At first, I thought it was from a booth set up by the drama club because only we would play something like that.  But when I went downstairs, I saw that it was actually from a booth by the new Amnesty International chapter in our school.  There were about three people sitting behind it, all of them younger (than me.)
<P>
At that moment, the semi-attractive, somewhat-nice guy from the table beside it shouted something.  It turned out that he was begging for them to turn off that music because it's so bad, damnit.  Now, I'm not sure exactly what purpose HE was there for, but his bunch are the type who play horrible ragga / soca / hip-hop-that's-menacing-but-not-good, at an inconsiderably LOUD volume every wretched day when they're selling prom tickets or publicizing their South Asian festival or gettin' jiggy with another breakdance-a-thon or Christ knows what else.
<P>
Anyway, the AI people were meekly defending themselves with "No, it's not sad..."  Of course, being a woman of, well, I guess anger, I told them to keep it on, and that it was in a way revenge for the crap they put us through every day.  I also reminded them that "all good music comes from the sixties".  Satisfied, I went back upstairs to my class, where I for whatever reason told my computer teacher about it, and he seemed amused, which was kind of cool, because the only things that really excite him are roller coasters, Star Wars and revolutionary programming techniques.  And he is NOT the type to feign amusement.
<P>
That night, we went to Starwalk buffet because after 10:30, it's cheaper.  We agreed that on the buffet table, everything looks so agreeable but as soon as it's in one's mouth, one can't wait to get rid of it.  As it turned out, my mint-chocolate ice-cream was laced with wasabi.  It wasn't just a speck that happened upon the icy mountain though, it was intricately woven in like a thread in a sock.  The first bite was quite a surprise.  I thought it tasted more sour than ice-cream should taste, and then the fire started.  After some gulps of water, we solved the mystery, (there was wasabi in it.)  Despite my companion's urges, I continued to pick at it.
<P>
Ohhh, Velvet Underground's "I Found A Reason" is the most beautiful song...
<P>
Yesterday, Dylan bought me a beautiful blue rose and some lovely secondary blue somethings, but managed to present it in the worst way possible.  We were in his car, and he asked me if I had brought a CD I was supposed to, and of course I forgot.  I began some self-reprimand when he said "Don't worry, I bought this!".  With one arm, he reached behind my seat (while driving) and dumped the flowers into my lap like dirty laundry.
<P>
Well, I have been wasting insane amounts of time on Minesweeper, (literally a couple of hours a day,) and just yesterday, I decided to start playing custom games, with the same dimensions as the expert grid (30 x 16), but with 150 mines instead of 99.  I have not won a single game since then.
