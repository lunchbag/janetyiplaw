Yesterday, I told a really bad joke. 
<P>
I was at work, scheduled to work from noon until 4pm. However, we were running late, so at 5pm, I was still there. I decided to call my mother to tell her I'd be late in coming home, since she was probably waiting for me to start dinner. 
<P>
So I went into the kitchen and telephoned her. I told her I estimated that I'd be home around 5:30. One of the cooks happened to be standing beside me and overheard. 
<P>
He said "5:30? Are you sure you'll be finished by then?" 
<P>
I said "Sure, we don't have too much left to do." 
<P>
Well, as it turned out, I wasn't done until 6:30. As I was leaving, the same cook asked me what happened to 5:30. 
<P>
Now here comes the punchline... 
<P>
"Yeah well, I meant Pacific time." 
<P>
(Epilogue: The worst part was that I didn't even get the time zone right. I should've said Central time, which is one hour behind us. So not only was it a bad joke, it was inaccurate as well.)
