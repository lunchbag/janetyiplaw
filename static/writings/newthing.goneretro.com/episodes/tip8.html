On September 20th, I received my eighth tip. 
<P>
It was an Italian function, and everyone wanted Espresso with sambuca. There was an Espresso machine at the front, and a table wanted me to bring them ten cups. 
<P>
However, when I got to the front, I found that the machine took its time in spitting out the juice, and there was a crowd of people in line. "No problem," I thought, "I'm being paid to be here; I can afford to wait." 
<P>
After a half hour though, I realized it was getting ridiculous. I went back to the table and explained to the ringleader that I couldn't bring them the coffee because it would take too long. 
<P>
So he gets this knowing smile on his face, takes out his wallet, and hands me a $5. "Now, can we have some Espresso please?" 
<P>
This other guy walked by and asked in a mock-shocked tone "Hey, what's going on here?" 
<P>
He responded innocently "What? I'm giving her a tip." 
<P>
So of course, I went back to the machine and waited. It was actually alright, because there was these two really nice gentlemen who kept complimenting me and helped me with getting the coffee. 
<P>
And that's how I got my eighth tip, as corrupted as it was.
