Ok, so now I'm almost done my layout.  It's taken me so long because I've been kept busy.
<P>
That's right!  Busy!
<P>
Busy quitting my jobs, washing all my clothes and preparing for university.  This Sunday is the day I have to have everything finished by, because next week, I will be livin' it up, like Ja Rule (Ja Rule is a loser.)
<P>
Monday afternoon will be the staff tournament at the golf club I work at.  I don't know anything about golf except that some people play it.  But apparently, that won't matter because the day will be about drinking beer and eating meat.  Tradition is that for dinner is a pig on a spit, but this year, we're having a steak that the cook tells me is cheap.  Whatever.
<P>
Then I will be picked up and dropped off at the bus station, where we will be driven to Montreal.  Woohoooo, I love Montreal.  Land value is so low and stuff is so cheap there.
<P>
Back on Sunday and off to school on Monday for frosh week.
<P>
Frosh week is so stupid, but I think I'm going to sign up for it.  How else will I get ahead in life?  Anyway, the only thing that sounds enticing that week is the "top secret mystery concert" on Tuesday.  The student federations were writing us letters, gushing about a concert played by a secret Canadian band - "We won't tell you WHO it is, you'll have to come to find out, but we guarantee you, you WON'T be disappointed!".
<P>
Of course, the woman - who's the head of new students or something - writes us a letter: "... and the Watchmen will be playing at the University on Tuesday..." and totally spoils it.
<P>
The Watchmen suck.  They had that ONE hit song "Stereo" which was no good but got plenty of airplay, and then nobody heard from them again.  Recently, they even tried to release a double-CD of stuff and sold it at a low price, but no one bought that either.  But since they're under the manager of Tragically Hip, I guess they'll be sticking around.
<P>
But a concert is a concert. I'll be there... unless if Laurier U has a better band playing...
