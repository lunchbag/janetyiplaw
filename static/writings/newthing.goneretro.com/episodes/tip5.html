On Monday, I received my fifth tip. 
<P>
I was at a Chinese fast-food court-type place with these two guys, one of whom was white. 
<P>
Andrew couldn't finish his noodles and wanted a box, but wanted me to ask for one, because Chinese people who got stuck with fast-food-related jobs can't speak English. 
<P>
I didn't order from the place, and since the Chinese are stingy, I didn't think they'd give me a box without a purchase. After some persuasion though, I went up to the counter and asked for a box. I said that it was for "that white guy", and pointed. Andrew got the cue and waved. (It was our predetermined plan.) The woman didn't care, she just told me that it'd be twenty cents. 
<P>
I went back to Andrew with the news. He gave me a quarter. I brought him the box and I told him I was going to keep the nickel as a tip. 
<P>
He wasn't listening, he was too busy dumping the food into the box. Of course, he did so upside-down, (that is, he poured his food on to the lid of the box.) We laughed at him and the matter of Janet's Fifth Tip was forgotten.
