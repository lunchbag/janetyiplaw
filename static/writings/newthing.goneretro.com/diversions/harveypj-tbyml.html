PJ Harvey is one of the most extraordinary female musicians of all time. This album's sound is simple, often seemingly using no more than two instruments, but creates a mood that fits the theme of each particular song. In "Working for the Man", her voice is lifeless and muffled and ends with a distorted bass line that abruptly stops. "Meet Ze Monsta" and "Long Snake Moan" uses a heavy menacing guitar and drums combination, which adds to the fearless and threatening sexual tension present. 

More importantly though, PJ Harvey's ultimate gifts are her rawness and the unhindered emotion in her music. She tears her themes apart and tells what she sees, then she tears herself apart so that pure feeling flows out, unobstructed by the flesh that she has stripped away. In "C'mon Billy", she wails in anguish for her long-gone lover to come home. The end-track "The Dancer" is a gorgeous ballad, calling out tears to join in its final heartbreaking embrace.
