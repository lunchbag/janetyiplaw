On Friday, April 19 2002, I went to the Garbage concert at the Kool Haus in Toronto. We got there as early as we could, which was 5pm. There were about 50 people in front of us, which was pretty good, but when we were going in, we discovered that the tickets that were supposed to be waiting for us in the office weren't. (That is, waiting for us.) 
<P>
So we had to wait and all these people got in before us and I became very sad and anxious, until a black van pulled up and out stepped a blond haired woman with our tickets, followed by Butch, Duke, Steve and Daniel. I stared at them and I could feel this rush go through me, (the same rush I got when I met Mike Harris and later on Dalton McGuinty... though I guess I did not actually feel too excited when I met McGuinty, because he'll never be elected Ontario's Premier, though he sure is handsome.) 
<P>
It was weird because no one else seemed to recognize them. Or at least, they didn't care. The boys kind of looked around, shook themselves off and went inside. I'm still kicking myself for not screaming something unintelligibly unintelligent. Anyways, we rushed in and got ourselves as close to the stage as possible, with about 5 layers of people in front of us, which wasn't too bad. We had an alright view. 
<P>
The opening act "Abandoned Pools" came on, but nobody really liked them because nobody knew who they were. Then Garbage came on, and they were so great, they really set us all on fire, especially with Shirley gazing into each and everybody's eyes as she prowled the stage... ('especially' meaning 'solely'.) 
<P>
That woman is extraordinary. She makes me stronger, I guess she's a kind of role model for me. The thing is, although she's not really conventionally beautiful, nor is her voice really that great when she's playing live, she emits this powerful aura... absolutely amazing... 
<P>
After that, I bought a shirt for $60, which is quite a lot, but it's alright because we didn't pay for our $40 tickets and I like the shirt. Then we went to eat, and that was the evening.
