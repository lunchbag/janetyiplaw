                I mean the reviews are worthwhile, but not necessarily the CD's. Most of the albums reviewed are either stuff I really like or really hate. But get them <a href="cds.html">here</a> anyway.
                <P>
                  Oh, and if you disagree with me, or have something to add, or wrote your own review that you want posted, then you can head right over to <a href="http://www.geocities.com" target="_new">Geocities</a> and make your own site.

                          This is my tribute to the Mr. Men books I used to read when I was young. I made this for my Writer's Craft class (June 2002). We were supposed to do a children's book, but I didn't want to do yet another silly alphabet book
                          ("A was an actor... B was a ballet dancer...") Knowing that the mark I would get in class would have no effect on my university entrance in September, I decided to go ahead with this, since it'd be much more fun.
