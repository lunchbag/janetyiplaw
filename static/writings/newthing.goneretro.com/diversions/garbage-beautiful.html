The main observation about the new Garbage disc is that it's a lot more commercial than its precessors. It emerges lyrically in its horrid simplicity, and musically in its varied styles. Shirley reportedly wrote all the lyrics, and they're not too abstract. They could have been written by a 14-year-old. But enough said on the topic, let's focus on the good. 
<P>
Musically, there are a lot of paths explored. "Shut Your Mouth" sounds like NIN (with bad lyrics). "Untouchable" is very urban r&b-ish; (Missy Elliot is supposed to be remixing this track.) "Can't Cry These Tears" has a golden-oldies feel, "Parade" sounds like a happy Pumpkins song, "Cherry Lips" is pure bubble gum (with occasional guitar), and "Breaking Up the Girl", the catchiest of the lot, is their take on The Beatles. 
<P>
There are three ballads: "Cup of Coffee" is sorrowful, "Drive You Home" is even more sorrowful and drives me to tears on a bad day, while "So Like a Rose" is sadly dreamy. The latter two are beautiful. So far, my favourite is "Nobody Loves You". It's "The World is Not Enough, part two." (Garbage did the theme song for the Bond movie.) It's very cinematic, very dark, very eerie. It's great. 
<P>
The whole album's great. Not as great as their debut or V2.0, but I love Garbage, so they're getting 5 chilli peppers.
