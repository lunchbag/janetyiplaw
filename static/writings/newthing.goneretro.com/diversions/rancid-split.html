After hearing this CD a few more times, I have reversed my earlier decision that Fat Mike should shut up. NOFX is great, and I would even say, outstages Rancid in this case. I mean, Rancid's cute and all, with the British-accented Tim jumping in between the earnest yells of Lars. However, in terms of creativity, they don't do much. They cover the songs, but it stops there. They basically just reproduced the tracks exactly as NOFX did, then called it a day. 
<P>
NOFX on the other hand, seem to have a lot of fun with it. Most songs sound like a NOFX song, especially Corazon de Oro, which transformed from a dreamy romantic Rancid work to a screeching NOFX work. The best track is the closing Radio. The original Radio song was already marvelously done by Rancid: it was very catchy and infectious without losing any of its punk quality. For this album though, NOFX nominated their hispanic El Hefe to do a reggae take on it. It sounds wonderful and completely different, and it just makes you want to bob your head and sing along in that silly Rustafarian voice: "When I got da music, den i got a place to go..."
