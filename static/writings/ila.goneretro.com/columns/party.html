<h2>Throwing an IL Party</H2>
<p>

So you've bragged to all your friends about how great your man is, and all the ritzy places he takes you to, and all the shiny rocks he buys you. Now they want to meet him. Of course, the problem is he's not real, and the excuse that he's "caught syphilis and won't be able to show" will only hold up for so long.
<P>
The perfect solution is to throw a party of course! Throw a party honouring your relationship with your sweetheart, invite your family and friends, and their curiosity will be satisfied once and for all. No longer will they suspiciously ask you questions, hound you for information or spy on you.
<P>
"That's great Janet," you say, "but you seem to be forgetting something very crucial. Mark's not real!"
<BR>"Sheetal honey," I say, "you've made it this far with him. Do you not have faith in the ILA's ability to throw a fabulous IL bash?"
<P>
So here it is: The ILA's Guide to Throwing a Fabulous IL Party.
<P><HR><P>
<B>Firstly, a warning of a possible obstacle:</B>
<BR>When people ask you what the "Imaginary" part of the Imaginary Lovers Anonymous patch you've sewed onto the tablecloth means, try to avoid answering directly. You don't want to outright lie and respond "Oh, that's a typo, I meant 'existing and very real'" although that would be tempting, (but how would you be able to live with yourself afterward?) Instead, say "Well, (imagariny lover's name) is present, so... uh... whatever..." Then, you must walk away quickly and pretend to busy yourself with something.
<P><HR><P>
The tacit reason that everyone's there will be to meet your companion, and you're going to have to fake it. The bad news is that this is the trickiest part. The good news is that once you've overcome this little block, you're pretty much flying. (I guess that wasn't really two separate pieces of news.) Anyway, there are many little things you can do to make your guests think they've met Him/Her without lying directly. These tips have been divided into the bite-sized sections below.
<P>&nbsp;<P>
<B>The Guests</B>
<P>
The key to this, and everything as well, is confusion. Invite people from many different social cliques. Make sure no one knows anyone. Invite your elderly mother and her bridge group, your pot dealer and his junkie puppies, then leave them in the same room to socialize. Of course they won't. In fact, make sure no one gets along or meets anyone new. This way, they'll never know if they're staring into the eyes of your lover, or just some unimportant homeless bum. After the party, when they complain that they didn't get to meet Him/Her, you can say "Yes you did! You were standing right next to him/her!". They'll smack themselves on the head and say "Damnit, that was him/her?? Crap, why didn't I take a better look?! Well, I guess you were right, they exist after all!", thus marking your win.
<P>
(You can also make out with lots of different people publicly; make sure people can see you though. The purpose of this should be obvious.)
<P>&nbsp;<P>
<B>The Decorations</B>
<P>
Get balloons, confetti, whatever. That's not important.
<P>
What is important will be the pictures on your walls. You'll have to do some preparation. A few days before the party, steal some of your preteen sister's YM magazines. Look through them and cut out pictures of good-looking male celebrities, (if you're a homosexual female or a heterosexual male, obtain issues of Hustler and do the same.)
<P>
Now, frame them and hang them on the walls of your house. While your guests are over, you can explain that you've got photographs of your lover on the wall, as well as pictures of good-looking popstars. (At this moment, feel free to make some sort of lewd joke.)
<P>
See, the trick is, your guests will recognize some of the pictures, but not all. When they point and ask "Who's that?" Answer in a really disgusted way "Don't you know?? That's Steven Joe, from 'The Steven Joe Band' from Glendale, Utah! Christ, they're on the radio, what's the matter with you?" They may ask a few more times, but soon, they'll be sick of your insulting manner and will refrain from any more questions they may have. They'll never know which frame holds the face of your beloved, and they'll spend the rest of the evening wondering.
<P>&nbsp;<P>
<B>The Attire/Theme</B>
<P>
The attire will depend on the theme you pick, if any, and if you want to take full advantage of people, a theme WILL be needed. Keep your objective of confusion in mind. Make it a traditional costume party, for example. Everyone will be hidden behind cloth and plastic. Never mind looking for your imagariny lover, they'll have difficulty finding the guy who's supposed to drive them home.
<P>
The weapon of distraction may also come into play. Make the theme "Beach" and you'll have all the chicks and dudes in bikinis and speedos, not necessarily in that order. Everyone will just be staring at each other, forgetting about everything else.
<P>&nbsp;<P>
<B>The Activities</B>
<P>
Most parties don't require any real activities agenda. You can get them to dance (see below) or have group sex (see above). Just don't play The Name Game.
<P>&nbsp;<P>
<B>The Music</B>
<P>
A good party has a wide variety of music to satisfy all tastes.
<P>
Your objective will not be to throw a good party. Your objective will be to deceive. You will use music as the tool of distraction that was just mentioned.
<P>
With this in mind, do not play pop. Few people dance to it, and that's just more time for them to look around and question you. Don't play ANY slow music at all. Only the good-looking people with real dates dance to this, and they probably don't care about your love life anyway.
<P>
The ideal thing to do is play hard acid-drenched techno. That's right, have a rave in your basement. Play Underworld cd's, install blinding flashing seizure-inducing lights and pass around ecstasy pills. Distraction achieved.
<P>&nbsp;<P>
<B>The Food</B>
<P>
When confronted with the demand "Hey, where's the food?", you can take the opportunity to be funny and answer "Well, it's an Imaginary Lovers Anonymous-sponsored party, so obviously, the food's imaginary as well! Ha ha!"
<P>
You better bring out the real food immediately after though, or else your guests will leave if they realize there's no free meal in it. Hey, if they've badgered you for pictures of your honey, they're probably shallow pigs who attend parties for all the wrong reasons (none of which involve them liking you and enjoying your company.)
