<h2>What Would Janet Do?</H2>
<p>
WWJD, an acronym, originated from Janet in August of 2001, after she realized the great extent of her wisdom, and came to the conclusion that the world would be a better place if everybody, when faced with a difficult decision, asked the question "What would Janet do?".
<P>
WWJD bracelets are also available for purchase. However, please be careful not to confuse our bands with those of the Christian group <A HREF="http://www.wwjd.com">WWJD</A>. A handy hint to look out for is that the Christian bracelets are usually in basic colours (ie red, yellow, blue, green) and printed on hemp or black nylon, while ours feature cheap pornographic images.

<B>On Love</B><BR>
No one is really sure if such a thing exists, and even if it does, who's guaranteeing that we'll all find it? Even though it probably is a beautiful thing, in this awful cruel world of ours, we must use it as best as we can to our advantage. So, girls, if you love someone, keep it a secret or else, he/she will leave you. Guys, even if you don't love someone, say that you do and you'll almost certainly get some.
<P>
<B>On Lies</B><BR>
Lies only hurt when the party being lied to finds out. Most of the time, lies are told to protect, not only others, but ourselves as well. Hypothetical situation: an obese and plain woman cannot find a companion, so she makes one up and pretends he/she is her lover. This is fine. In conclusion, lies, that are within reason, are okay.
<P>
<B>On Politics</B><BR>
It's not a right, it's a privilege to be living under democratic laws and we must all perform our civil duty and vote so - ahh no one cares, you're all just here because you're lonely and looking for love. Next topic.
<P>
<B>On Sex</B><BR>
Most people will never even come close. If any of you are offered the occasion though, take it, it doesn't matter who or what it is, it may be your only chance!
<P>
<B>On Masturbation</B><BR>
We're all human, and if we can't find someone else, we may as well love ourselves. So yep, it's okay boys!
<P>
<B>On Pornography</B><BR>
It's a helpful aid for self-loving. It's also the only thing beautiful people are good for, right?
<P>
<B>On Bastard Pregnancies</B><BR>
Again, most of you will never have sex, and you need to have sex in order to get pregnant. Obviously, this won't be an issue. Next topic.
<P>
<B>On Abortion</B><BR>
See above. Next topic.
<P>
<B>On Immigration</B><BR>
Sure, why not?
<P>
<B>On Prostitution</B><BR>
I don't think anyone would be willing to pay you guys for sex. In fact, you'd probably have to pay THEM, which would make THEM the prostitute. Or was that your question? If so, then sure, it's okay.
<P>
<B>On Animal Rights</B><BR>
No, it's wrong to have sex with animals.
<P>
<B>On Weapons and Violence</B><BR>
Nah, death sucks, it is basically eternal loneliness. If you think you're miserable NOW...
<P>
<B>On Death</B><BR>
See above. Next topic.
<P>
<B>On the Environment</B><BR>
As cool as it sounds to do it against the wall of a Manhattan alley or the floor of a horsebarn, you've got to remember there are all sorts of weird diseases flying around.  Thus, YES, the setting for your lust IS important; my friends, stick with the bedroom.  (Unless of course if your partner insists on it, in which case you must comply with his/her demands lest he/she leaves.)
<P>
<B>On Genetic Engineering</B><BR>
At first, it may SEEM like a good idea. However, if you think about it, you'll realize that as more and more people are genetically altered, they'll become more and more physically attractive, which would make us look even uglier, thus reducing our chances of finding a partner. (Face it, the world is a shallow, shallow place.) Conclusion: say NO to genetic engineering!
<P>
<B>On Capital Punishment</B><BR>
Um, yeah, whatever.
<P>
<B>On Creation versus Evolution</B><BR>
Uh... creating an imaginary companion is okay... evolution... evol... I don't even know what that means.
<P>
<B>On Euthanasia</B><BR>
I don't know what that means.
<P>
<B>On Media Ethics and Accountability</B><BR>
What the - look, it's pretty obvious I don't know much outside my specialized field, so let's stay in it. 
<P>
<B>On Love</B><BR>
Oh, yeah, love is good.
