<h2>My Blind Date with an Imaginary Casanova</H2>
<p>
After being dumped last year by my fiancé Fred, I plunged into a state of depression that lasted for months. At my lowest point, I stole a mannequin from a local retailer, painted a moustache on its face, and pinned a name tag "Fred" on its chest. It was after three months of taking it around with me, to work, to my aerobic classes, to my therapy sessions, and to bed, that I realized that Fred was in fact, a female mannequin. It was too late for me to care. Sadly, Fred was lost in an incident involving a hot barbeque. Let's just say I've never seen so much melted plastic in my life. After I lost Fred-for the second time- I was devastated. I thought I'd never be able to mend the broken heart I harboured on the inside. 
<P>
One of my girlfriends suggested I hit the dating scene again. But at my age, and with my looks, I was a bit apprehensive. So she suggested I go out with one of her exs, an Imaginary Lover. I'll be honest with you, I was very nervous about going out with an Imaginary Lover, as Fred had left me for one of their kind. It's not like I have anything against Imaginary Lovers, in fact I almost respect them. So to prove I'm not a bigot, I decided to throw caution to the wind and accept the offer.
<P>
It was the most wonderful time of my life.
<P>
"Casanova" showed up at 7:00pm sharp ( I love a punctual lover!), dressed to the nines. He took me to dinner, a movie, dancing, and after all this was over, the icing on the cake; we went for a long walk on the beach. What's interesting to note is that I live in a part of the country where there aren't any beaches within a 100 mile radius. When he took me home on his motorcycle, I began wondering how the night was going to end. It didn't. I'm not one to air my dirty laundry to the public, so I won't. I will, instead leave you with my testimonial that Imaginary Lovers do make the best lovers. I am lonely no more. Thank you Imaginary Casanova.
