      <p><font size="2"><b>Description</b>: <br>
        Obsessively girl-crazy, he'll go after anything pretty, using cheap pickup 
        lines he's heard on tv. When finally presented with a 'yes', he'll become 
        so overjoyed and excited, that he'll clumsily walk into a pole, creating 
        a humourous noise of some sort.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>As a lover</b>:<br>
        His adolescent hormones will make him eager to go far, but during the 
        afterglow, he'll suddenly become frightened about the consequences he's 
        not ready to handle. He'll make an excuse to go get something from the 
        store but he won't come back. He'll avoid you the next day at school.</font></p>

        He's the shy kid who everyone thought was gay until he rescued his entire 
        class from the burning school. However, his fame is his demise, and his 
        huge inflated ego has started to be increasingly annoying.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>As a lover:</b><br>
        He needs to feel in control all the time, and will want to have everything 
        his way. He's also got several weird fetishes, particularly the costume 
        bit.</font></p>
