<h2>Members</H2>
So far, we have <B>2</B> founders and <B>7</B> members, after I decided to add the founders to the member count.
<p><HR><P>

<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Founders:</B></FONT>
<P>
<B>Janet the Romantic</B>
<BR>She's the poet of our time.
<P>
<B>Empress Sheetal</B>
<BR>Currently in treatment for emotional suffering, after learning that her Imaginary Lover Jojo Gonzalez was real.

<p><HR><P>
<FONT SIZE="3"><B>Members:</B></FONT>
<P>
<B>Anjo</B>
<BR>He frequently attends Janet's N'Sync and S Club 7 parties. On the constant quest to find the answer to the burning question: What's the deal with this pop life and when is it gonna fade out?
<P>
<B>Bill Po</B>
<BR>Not the former president, though he has many of the aforementioned's suave qualities (namely, the desire to get some.)
<P>
<B>Janet</B>
<BR>See <I>Founders</I>.
<P>
<B>Jigga</B>
<BR>He thinks he's black, and he is, but only in the imaginary world his mind has created. 
<P>
<B>Jonny Mack</B>
<BR>He somehow got involved with Janet in real life, and look what's happened to him now.  (What's especially funny is that he doesn't even know he's a member.)
<P>
<B>Sheetal</B>
<BR>See <I>Founders</I>.
<P>
<B>TKO</B>
<BR>On the streets, he's seemingly rude and heartless. In his mind, he's the same thing, but at least the ladies want him.
