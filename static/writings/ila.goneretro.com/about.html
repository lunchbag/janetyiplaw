<h2>About Us</H2>
<p>

Throughout history, humans have been known to make up imaginary friends when they are feeling lonely. Quite predictably, with the new age of the revelation of the consequences of love and sex, finding an appropriate lover can prove quite difficult. 
<P>
And so came the creation of the Imaginary Lover. Although studies show that having an imaginary lover indeed has their advantages, sadly, these individuals are often ridiculed, and labelled a "Pathetic Loner". As a result, many of us are oppressed and feel the pressure to conform to the public, who states that thou shalt either have a real lover, or none at all. The brave ones who stay true to themselves are considered outcasts. 
<P>
And that's what we're here for. Welcome to Imaginary Lovers Anonymous. 
<P>
An Imaginary Lover can be the best or worse experience one can ever have, depending on how you make of the situation. For some, the practice is totally unfamiliar while for others, it's the only way to go. 
<P>
The ILA was formed to support the community, in helping them make the right decisions. Whenever you feel the weigh of a romantic imaginary conflict, never hesitate to ask for help. After all, that's what we're all here for: to help one another...
