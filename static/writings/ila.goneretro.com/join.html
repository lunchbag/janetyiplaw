<h2>Join the ILA!</H2>
<p>

To join the Yahoo! club, visit us at <a href="http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/imaginaryloversanonymous">http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/imaginaryloversanonymous</a>. Click on "JOIN" in the upper right corner, then contact us, so we can update our member count. 
<P>
However, no longer is a Yahoo! account necessary. Simply <a href="contact.html">contact</a> us one way or another and threaten to burst our bubble if we don't let you in.
<P>
But don't worry, we are as desperate for new members as we are for love. Please join!
