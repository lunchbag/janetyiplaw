<h2>Welcome!</H2>
<p>

<H6>January 2003</H6>
<P>
We are very happy that you have come for a visit to our little hub.  Although you may not necessarily decide to become a member, at the very least, you are giving us a chance, which is what all of us really need.
<P>
Recently, there have been some major developments in the Imaginary Lovers Anonymous community.  Firstly, the lack of activity was due to most of us going away for university September 2002, (but it doesn't really explain the absence before September,) and now that I am back for a work term in Toronto, I have a bit more time to devote to this once again.

<P>But wait, there's more! Sheetal is still at school, but she doesn't seem to be too interested in this project anymore, so I'm going to take the reigns and continue to march the ILA forward.

<P>So now that I am in charge, we may be moving to our own domain soon.  Watch for a change of address that ISN'T under this crappy dependent Sympatico server!  Also, I've decided to get rid of our YahooClubs affliation.  We're just getting bombarded with automated porn ads on our message boards - well... actually now that I think about it, maybe I'll leave it up.
<P>
Anyway, there you go.  We're still very much active (though perhaps alone,) and new members are always welcome!
<P>
Lots of love,
<BR>janet
