<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</H2>
<p>
As soon as we finish learning Perl, which will happen some time after we start, we will put up a way so that you can actually email us without those scary spam robots coming after us.  In the meantime, do what you can with our current <a href="contact.html">contact</a> methods.
<P><HR width="75%">


<p><B>What's the ILA all about?</B>
<BR>We are a group of people who have unsatisfactory romantic lives, who are now joined together in support. We exchange tips and stories, hold 'bachelor' parties, and run this website that contains valuable information and columns of interest to those who realize that they will never be loved. 

<p><B>Who maintains the ILA website?</B>
<BR>Since Sheetal left this behind and Janet escalated her geek status, naturally, it's Janet.<P>

<p><B>Can I contribute to the ILA website?</B>
<BR>Yes, we will gladly accept written columns, questions and comments, first sons, whatever.  Just visit the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> section.<P>

<p><B>How do I become a member of the ILA?</B>
<BR>To become a member, visit the <a href="join.html">Join</a> section and follow the instructious.<P>

<p><B>How do I become a founder of the ILA?</B>
<BR>To become a founder, you would have to start the ILA.<P>

<p><B>Can I still be a member if I'm not single?</B>
<BR>You can't be a member if you're not truthful.<P>

<p><B>Why do you refer to yourself as 'we'?</B>
<BR>It makes us sound more like a legitimate group, unlike those other hack groups, (the one that comes to mind is the <a href="http://www.nra.org">NRA</a> for some reason.)<P>

<p><B>How are you different from all those other hubs for pathetic washed-out singles who read cheap romance novels?</B>
<BR>We are optimistic but realistic.  We do not pretend that there is hope, rather, we help people accept their fate agreeably.<P>

<p><B>Hey Janet, why the hell did you list me as a member? I don't remember joining.</B>
<BR>Of course you did, silly.<P>

<p><B>How do I remove myself from the ILA and all its affiliations?</B>
<BR>To become a member, visit the <a href="join.html">Join</a> section and follow the instructious.<P>

<p><B>What's your favourite colour?</B>
<BR>Before, when I was really superstitious and religious, I thought that blue and white were the colors of heaven, while red and black were the colours of hell.  I told myself that my favourite colour was blue, and eventually it was so, even though I hated the way blue looked on me and everything around me.  But then one day, I realized my foolishness, and that heaven and hell are state of minds and regardless of anything, a favourite colour does not imply goodness or evil.  After eventual changes in style and taste, I now find all my clothing in various shades of red, my current favourite colour.<P>

<p><B>I bet no one actually asked any 'frequently asked questions' and you're just pretending that you got all these emails.</B>
<BR>Yep.  That's correct.  I'm just sitting here alone on my laptop waiting for Saturday Night Live to start so I can miss it again, thinking about eating something, and listening to Coldplay's "In My Place" and wondering why their brand of English wuss music can be so popular.  (That's right, I'm here programming on the computer on a lovely Saturday night.) <P>
