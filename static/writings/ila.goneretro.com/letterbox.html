<p> Dear ILA,<br>
  I have this friend (real) who isn't a member - but I'm pretty sure most people know who I'm talking about - and he's more than a little messed up. First he said a (real) 13 year old girl was hot and now he's gotten much worse. He's secretly with an 11 year old imaginery lover (he's 18!) and I don't know whether I should get him help or just turn him into the cops.<br>

  Hahahahhahaha, he's messed up.<br>

<p>Dear ILA,<br>
  It took a lot of courage to write to this group, and even now, I'm not sure if this is the right thing to do. I have a very embarassing problem... When I'm with my imaginary sweetheart, it's difficult to... uh... I've got male-specific problems, and it's not very satisfying for either of us. I am desperate for advice, but as you can probably tell by the nature of my conflict, it's something I'm very self-conscious about, so I would really appreciate it if I can remain anonymous.<br>

<p><i>It's very understandable to not want others to know about one's private life, imaginary or not, (especially when it is indeed imaginary.) As much as I would like to help, since I am not male, nor have I ever been with a real one, I am clueless as to what to do, (I'm not even sure of what you're talking about.) However, I have posted your situation, along with your email address on the community center bulletin board, (don't worry, I have NOT given out your name!)

<p>Dear ILA, <br>
  After reading all the other posts, I feel I need to admit that I had an imaginary lover once too. Or so I thought... After the sex and after the drunkeness went away that one night, I realized that my lover was indeed not imaginary, but real. But I also realized that it was not a person, but an exhaust pipe... <br>

<p>Dear ILA, <br>
  I had been going out with Robert, my Imaginary Lover, for about six months when I realized I was pregnant. I was surprised at first, but also overjoyed, since I turn fifty-two this month and have wanted a baby for most of my life. I would have thought Robert would be happy too, but to my surprise, he got this weird expression on his face when I told him. Later that night when I came home from my job as caretaker of the local elementary school, all my possessions were gone! I saw a note with the dreaded three words: &quot;I never existed.&quot;  I'm so hurt! Emotionally as well as physically, since I am still pregnant! The baby's due in seven months! What should I do? <br>

<p><i>Don't worry, remember that every relationship ends some time or another. You have to move on, go out and try to find someone else. And as for the baby, we're still trying to figure out how you got impregnated by an Imaginary Lover.  We'll contact you with further advice when we succeed, which might take a while.

<p>Dear ILA, <br>
  I have a question that's been bothering me for a long time. Does a person have to be attractive and slim to have an Imaginary Lover? I'm asking for my friend.

<p><i>Of course not! That's the beauty of the whole concept of Imaginary Lovers! You can have an ass as wide as a cow's and still get asked out by people who only exist in your mind! Physical, as well as mental, emotional, sexual, or intellectual characteristics will never pose as a problem if you decide to follow the ILA lifestyle. Good luck! <br>
