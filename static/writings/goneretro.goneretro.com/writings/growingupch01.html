When I was in grade two, at lunch one day, I had a little snack bag that I couldn't open so I went to the lunch monitors, who were two older grade five girls.  One of them was Chinese and the other was Caucasian.  As the Caucasian girl was cutting open the bag for me, the Chinese girl made a face and said "eww what *IS* that?".  The Caucasian girl looked through the transparent package and replied easily "corn flakes", not noticing her friend's reaction.
<P>
I giggled secretly.  They were actually dried crab flakes.
