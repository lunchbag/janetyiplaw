The FIFA World Cup starts this Friday June 9th, and there are plenty of reasons to get excited, even for the individual who shies away from spectator sports.  Especially when the only other sporting event is a crappy skating testosterone festival involving sticks and junk.
<P>
The biggest argument for the importance of football is that it is what man was born to do.  Sport in its essence instinctively brings out the competition, skill, and strategy in its participants.  So natural is the nature of football, that human beings throughout history in all parts of the world have been known to run around kicking shit with their feet for recreation.  Cavemen before God's time were playing football, as were ancient Eastern philosophers, Anglo-Saxon barbarians, soldiers in the World Wars, and of course, if you've seen the highly moving film <I>City of God</I>, today's inner-city Brazilian kids.  Compare this with hockey, which is only played by Northern hemisphere countries above the Tropic of Snow line, and which only really gained popularity in 1989 in response to the Berlin Wall tear-down.
<P>
Beauty is in simplicity, and football requires little equipment.  The only things you need are: participants well-versed in bipedalism, something you can kick, and some things that aren't nothing that can be used as markers for goals.  Hell, your 'ball' doesn't even need to be able to roll.  Ever heard of 'blocking'?  It's an age-old game resembling football but with a block, most popular in the forest regions of Flatland.  On the other hand, according to the UN Sports Commission, any basic game of hockey requires participants with working arms and legs, sticks and full military protection gear for each participant, something that's a thing that must be able to glide magically, and a big eyesore patch of ice.  Oh, and designated caricatures on each team to pick fights when things get slow, because that seems to happen pretty often.  There is much discussion on the influence of commerce on modern professional sports, as explored in various dystopian fiction in which games with lots of needed equipment are invented to support the industry.  Despite how professional football may or may not have degraded to that level ' the simple fact is that you can still play the game with a group of dirt-poor mentally-retarded orphans.  Not so with hockey, my friend.
<P>
Football has been criticized that it is slow-moving.  It takes 'like freakin' forever' to get the ball from one end of the field to the other.  However, in a game like hockey where goals can be scored within the last five seconds of the game, any strategic element can be considered independent of cause-and-effect.  Having the puck on the right end of the rink is worth nothing if it didn't take much to get it there, and it doesn't take much to get it out.  In other words, strategy is non-existent in hockey.  Tense moment of the game but gotta go pee?  No worries, since the next moment has nothing to do with the current.  Rewards based on randomness are not appreciated, as opposed to rewards based on hard work and accumulation of advances, as it is in football and the casino.
<P>
And this is why everybody is excited about football.  Football is a biologically-natural human activity, and focuses on true and pure ability as opposed to trimmings like industry support and good looks.  Canada is quite the popular kid in the international community but didn't make the cut because she didn't have the goods.  Meanwhile, nations with relatively repulsive reputations like all those starving countries sponsored by World Vision were considered and accepted provided they had the ability.  Even Iran.
<P>
The World Cup is truly world.  Each team represents an entire nation, and that nation's complete ideology.  The World Cup induces loyalty, passion, and excitement like no other professional sports tournament.  Remember in 2002, when Britain played Brazil in the semi-finals and lost, and in turn, the Anglos immediately switched sides to support Germany (who qualified for the finals) and cheered extra-violently?  There was a lot of racism that went on during the week after the Brazil-England match, and a lot of straight-up aggression taken out in all parts of English fans' daily life: on the road, at school and work, at the granary, everywhere.  That was passion.  People loved and hated, because people cared.  No one cares about hockey and no one cares about your loser North American city in your 'world' tournament.  If you win the cup, nobody gives a damn except for Calgary and that's only if you're Edmonton.  When people google the Stanley Cup winning team, you know what they see?  Nothing about hockey: just links about your murder of your own protesting students, your dead auto industry fueling unemployment, or your dirty polluted lake catching on fire.
