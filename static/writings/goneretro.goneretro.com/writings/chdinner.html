For the non-Oriental male dating an Asian chick about to sit down for dinner with her family for the first time.  Note that this article will be heterosexist, because Chinese gays aren't allowed to come out.  This article also assumes the man to be white, as most Asian girls aren't allowed to date anybody outside of the Southeast Asian and Caucasian circles.  It doesn't matter how much money you have.  I'm really sorry, but sadly, this is how the culture's tradition is.  If you find yourself to be an exception, then there must be some horrible mistake.  Perhaps you were never invited to dinner in the first place, or more likely, they don't know about your not being Caucasian or not being straight, in which case, you'll need to get it all sorted out right away.
<P>

<B>--- THE FIRST THING ---</B>

<P>
The first thing you have to realize is that it is a big deal.  Even if you've met her parents before, you don't truly meet a Chinese household until they open their door for you to sit down at their table and eat their food.
<P>  It is a big deal because when it comes to a boyfriend who is anything more than a high school fling, all Oriental girls need the approval of their parents, particularly from the mother.  If your girl has a deep connection with her family, it's clear that if you make a bad first impression and her parents think you're a loser, then she'll think you're a loser, and it's all over for you.
<P>Less obvious is if your girl is one of those independent and free-spirited fireballs who fiercely craves to be out of her parents' clutches.  As rebellious as she may claim to be, and as often as you hear the line "I wouldn't like a boy my parents like", she desperately needs to show her family that she is capable of finding a good partner without their help.  If you screw up, you humiliate her in front of her we-told-you-so parents, and she'll never forgive you, particularly when her parents start setting her up with their gossiping friends' geeky sons and citing you as a bad example of what will happen if they give her any sort of freedom again ("Ah-Chung's son make sixty t-ousand a year!  White gwai-lo make nothing but mess.")
<P>
Chinese pride is infinitely important; it never forgives, it never forgets.
<P>
And that's why it's such a big deal.  If you don't think it should be, then at least play along like at a Catholic school.  If you don't think you are willing to play along, then re-evaluate how much you treasure this funny-looking woman and decide between faking it for one night to please her, or ending the romance right here, right now.
<P>
As horrible as the worst scenario will be, the best, (and more likely with the help of this article!) scenario is that you are able to impress her family and she will be very, very grateful to you.  And you know what that means.
<P>
<B>Before the meal</B>
<P>
The mother will be in the kitchen preparing the meal.  The daughter will either be helping her (and whispering quietly about you,) or assigned by the mother to entertain you.  That will probably be the first thing the family does for you that you won't notice.
<P>
The mother will call everybody to dinner, and the family will assemble at the dinner table.  The group will be asked to do small tasks, like find an extra chair for the special guest (you), or put out another spoon for the beef tendon sauce, or something.  If you are asked to do something small, take it as a sign that the mother is trying to reach out to you and include you as one of the family.  Don't be offended if you are asked if you prefer a fork and knife to chopsticks - but you better not accept the offer.
<P>
<B>Wait for everybody</B>
<P>
Everybody will sit down and the mother will be scrambling to put out the final dishes.  For fuck's sake, DO NOT START TO EAT until everybody starts eating.  The mother, that scheming siren, will probably urge you to start eating without her while she quickly does something.  Don't fall for that.  If you so much as poke at your chopsticks on the table, the thought in everybody's minds will be what kind of family could possibly raise such a monstrous boy.  If you are confused, look to your girlfriend and do whatever she does.
<P>
<B>Say the right things</B>
<P>
When your girl starts to eat, you may start as well.  Within the first minute, you will need to make some kind of praise statement about the food, specifically: how great it tastes, you've never had anything like it, thanks so much to the skilled cook for putting so much time and effort into making the meal.  Once again, that scheming mother will utter lies like how her talentless memory caused her to forget to put in salt, or how she simply did not have enough time to do anything grand, and ask for your forgiveness for making you consume such a horrible meal.  Don't believe it.
<P>
<B>Don't say the wrong things</B>
<P>
Do not make suggestions.  Do not sniff the food.  Do not compare it to something you've had before made by someone you know personally, ie your mom, though you may compare it to something similar you had in an impressive setting, ie an expensive restaurant in Europe.  "Hong Kong-style cooking" is basically trying to mimic the dishes of the European high class in a home kitchen setting and failing to get it right.  Don't point that out.
<P>
<B>Converse but be mindful</B>
<P>
At this point, the father will probably be trying to engage you in conversation.  If you want to make the man happy, be good to his ego.  Don't correct his mistakes.  Ask questions but don't challenge him.  Let him tell you his boring stories.  If you don't understand something he said, you have two chances to ask "What?".  After that, you're going to have to make up what he said.  Don't worry about mishearing him.  He's mishearing every other word you're saying and continuously piecing together what he thinks you're trying to say, so don't be surprised when you are telling him a sad story about your dead aunt and he says "yes, it's important to stay in school" and then starts to rave about the beauty of marine life.  It's not his fault, and if you think it is, just remember that his English is better than your Chinese.
<P>
<B>Eat that</B>
<P>
While the father is telling you crazy tales that are probably true, the mother will be putting things into your bowl, and scolding the daughter for not putting enough things in your bowl.  Know this: Everything that gets put into your bowl is the BEST PART of the dish.  In a Communist setting, dishes are all laid out in the middle and everybody has to be considerate to take food without avoiding the worst parts and hogging the best parts.  As the guest, everybody will be sacrificing the best parts to you.  So eat that crab head white boy, I know you only eat the legs in your culture, but there are only two sides of the head and you get a whole half shell while the rest of the family shares the other half.
<P>
<B>No touching</B>
<P>
Ok sailor, for the last time, don't try to discreetly touch your girl under the table or anything like that.  Touching under the table is reserved for the far more important purpose of your girl letting you know how you're doing.  A soft caressing hand means you're doing well.  A sharp kick means you screwed up, a stream of kicks means you're still screwing up and you need to stop.  Now.  
<P>
<B>--- ONE LAST THING ---</B>
<P>
Although the first dinner may now be sounding like an ordeal, remember the golden truth: Chinese women show their love by giving food.  With all the civil wars, poverty, and famine the Chinese have endured, many of us simply are unable to hug and kiss and say loving things like you luckier ones with your offshore colonialization games.  An invitation to "Dinner at the Wong's" is not simply an invitation to eat animal parts and fungus species you can't name.  It is an opportunity for those awkward harsh-toned judgemental foreigners to love you unconditionally by virtue of your karmic connection with their daughter.
<P>
Remember that, and appreciate it.
