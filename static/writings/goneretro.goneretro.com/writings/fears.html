<P>
Oh yeah, I almost forgot... YOU'RE WELCOME!
<P>&nbsp;<P>
<B>20. Poverty</B>
<BR>If you can afford access to a computer to read these words, you're probably living in a country that will never let you hopelessly starve to death.
<P>
<B>19. Flying</B>
<BR>Just don't fly.  Oh you have to cross oceans, you say?  Well, you can sail.  You'll manage.  Before the invention of comfort, we all came here by boat.  Illegally too.
<P>
<B>18. The wrath of God</B>
<BR>There are 2.5 billion people in India and China.  Yes, some of us say we're Christian but our English isn't that great, and we don't know what we're telling you half the time.  And of course, 2.5 billion people can't all be wrong!
<P>
<B>17. Adulthood</B>
<BR>As a young-at-heart technician at work told me with a grin: "It's mandatory to grow old, but optional to grow up."  Social standards are dead buddy, go down to the Toronto Comic Convention in August and check out the old dudes in costumes.

<P>
<B>16. Zombies</B>
<BR>Zombies are pretty damn scary, but remember their true power lies in their numbers.  Individually, they're slow and dumb.  They're nothing.  And you're nothing too if you're not in the group.  The moral is: if your world is ever overcome by zombies, pretend to be one of them and nobody will eat you.  Maybe that's a metaphor.

<P>
<B>15. Old Age</B>
<BR>"I believe in low lights and trick mirrors.  I believe in plastic surgery."
<BR>-- <I>Andy Warhol</I>

<P>
<B>14. Crowds</B>
<BR>Have an erotic fantasy where you're surrounded by hundreds of desperate girls.  This works even if you're a straight girl... but I make no guarantees.

<P>
<B>13. The US government</B>
<BR>I can't write anything about this subject.  I don't want to leave a paper trail.

<P>
<B>12. Failure</B>
<BR>If you're old enough to read, you're likely old enough to know a lot of stupid people already, and they must not all be complete failures.  That should reassure you.

<P>
<B>11. Fear Dot Com</B>
<BR>This movie really sucked.  It was a total rip-off of <I>The Ring</I>, which was a great movie, but we couldn't even sit through half of this one, even though we usually like bad movies.

<P>
<B>10. Marilyn Manson</B>
<BR>This isn't <I>The Ring</I>, and he's not going to come out of your television to kill you.  <I>The Ring</I> was a really good movie.

<P>
<B>9. Spiders</B>
<BR>Eww... can't help you here.

<P>
<B>8. Country music</B>
<BR>If you don't like country music, it's probably because you've only heard bad country music.  For something mainstream but enjoyable, pick up a copy of the <I>O Brother Where Art Thou</I> soundtrack.

<P>
<B>7. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</B>
<BR>Winners don't do drugs.  Don't be a loser.  Smarten up, kid.

<P>
<B>6. Computer hackers</B>
<BR>They know a lot, seem to control your world, and make more money than you.  But when the power goes out in Y3K, you cowboys with the big guns will be the ones laughing.  Heh heh heh...

<P>
<B>5. Girls</B>
<BR>Girls are stupid.  Just read them some poetry, listen to them whine about their problems, and build them a cake or something.

<P>
<B>4. Tears for Fears</B>
<BR>"Everybody wants to rule the world."  Hey, according to their website, they have a new album coming out in September?  I guess coming out of retirement is the new thing, with Social Security in its state and all.  New Order's new album is pretty good though.

<P>
<B>3.Rats</B>
<BR>Just think of them as lovable gerbils.  But don't touch them.  They're filthy and full of disease.

<P>
<B>2. Disease</B>
<BR>As the world gets dirtier, the last thing you want to do is eat organic.  Remember War of the Worlds?  The lesson was that we should adapt and eat dirtier.  Now go fish your next meal out of an urban dumpster.  That homeless crazy guy may not have any friends, but he'll live longer than all of yours.  And friends don't mean shit when you're in the ground, princess.

<P>
<B>1. Snakes on a Plane</B>
<BR>Snakes are nothing to be scared of.  Back in Hong Kong, we used to eat those same snakes as an after-daycare snack.
