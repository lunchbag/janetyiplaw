In grade one, I lived in a Toronto neighbourhood that had a large proportion of uneducated immigrant families.  Although many people did not understand a word of English, they nonetheless lovingly attended their children's school events as often as they could.
<P>
One evening, just before a school concert was about to start, the janitor went to the front of the room and reminded everybody to please place their litter into the appropriate garbage bins.
<P>
Nobody understood a word he said.  Everybody applauded politely.
