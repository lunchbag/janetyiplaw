After a lack-of-update inquiry from Eric Vieth, my favourite rock star, I have uploaded a new piece of bad writing: "20 Common Fears and What to Do About Them".
<P>

<font SIZE="2" COLOR="gray">[06/08/06]</font>
<BR>
Uploaded new writing in time for the FIFA World Cup: "Football and Hockey: Purity versus Hack".
<P>

<font SIZE="2" COLOR="gray">[04/25/06]</font>
<BR>
Uploaded two short writings: "Growing Up Chinese #1", "Growing Up Chinese #2".
<P>

<font SIZE="2" COLOR="gray">[04/24/06]</font>
<BR>
Uploaded two sets of photographs.
<P>

<font SIZE="2" COLOR="gray">[04/23/06]</font>
<BR>
Made some style and minor content changes.
