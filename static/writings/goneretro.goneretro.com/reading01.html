Something my sister forwarded me via email.  I think it does a great job of questioning the absurdity of a "traditional" idea.

<B>12 Reasons Homosexuals Should Not Get Married</B>
<P>
1. Homosexuality is not natural, much like eyeglasses, polyester, and birth control.
<P>
2. Heterosexual marriages are valid because they produce children. Infertile couples and old people can't legally get married because the world needs more children.
<P>
3. Obviously, gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children.
<P>
4. Straight marriage will be less meaningful if Gay marriage is allowed, since Britney Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage was meaningful.
<P>
5. Heterosexual marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are property, blacks can't marry whites, and divorce is illegal.
<P>
6. Gay marriage should be decided by people, not the courts, because the majority-elected legislatures, not courts, have historically protected the rights of the minorities.
<P>
7. Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America.
<P>
8. Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.
<P>
9. Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract.
<P>
10. Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why single parents are forbidden to raise children.
<P>
11. Gay marriage will change the foundation of society. Heterosexual marriage has been around for a long time, and we could never adapt to new social norms because we haven't adapted to things like cars or a longer lifespan.
<P>
12. Civil unions, providing most of the same benefits as marriage with a different name are better, because a "separate but equal" institution is always constitutional. Separate schools for African-Americans worked just as well as separate marriages for gays and lesbians will.
