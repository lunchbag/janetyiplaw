<B> Bush bruised in bicycle crash</B>
<P>
George Bush has collided with a police officer during a bike ride on the grounds of the Scottish hotel hosting the G8 summit.
<P>
The US president suffered scrapes on his hands and arms and was treated by a White House doctor, his spokesman said.
<P>
The police officer, on security duty, was sent to a local hospital to be treated for a minor ankle injury.
<P>
Mr Bush, celebrating his 59th birthday, was said to be going at a "pretty good speed" when he fell from his bike.
<P>
It was lightly raining at the time of the accident and Mr Bush slid onto the road, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said.
<P>
<B>Accident prone?</B>
<P>
The doctor bandaged the grazes and Mr Bush was taken back to the summit venue in a van.
<P>
It did not prevent him attending a dinner with other leaders of the world's most powerful nations, hosted by the Queen.
<P>
Mr Bush took up cycling seriously after a knee injury forced him to give up running some years ago.
<P>
This is not the president's first accident.
<P>
In May 2004, he was badly grazed after falling off his mountain bike during a ride at his Texas ranch and, in June 2003, he fell off his hi-tech Segway scooter.
<P>
In January 2002, he grazed his cheek after choking on a pretzel and fainting.
