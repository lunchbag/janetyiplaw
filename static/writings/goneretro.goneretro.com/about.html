With her very employable literacy and motor skills, Janet is also quite the looker in settings of low lights and trick mirrors. Throughout the day, she can often be found indulging in laundry (the fifth dimension) and paranoia (the ultimate state of awareness). In her spare time, Janet enjoys cooking and films - but not really.
