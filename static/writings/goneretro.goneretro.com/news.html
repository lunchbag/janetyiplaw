<BR>so i've noticed that my appetite has returned to normal.  the three weeks after going vegetarian, i was an absolutely ravenous beast.  the doctor turned out to be right, the whole i-have-tapeworms idea was just due to a bipolar thing and nothing to worry about.  i guess i shouldn't have attacked him like that.
