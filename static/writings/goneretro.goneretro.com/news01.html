<B>Save the Seals >> Boycott Canadian Seafood</B>
<P>

Dear Activist,
<P>
Please help us stop the Canadian seal hunt by organizing a
demonstration at a Red Lobster location in your area on June 25th -
Red Lobster Day of Action.
<P>
Animal Alliance of Canada and PETA are encouraging Red Lobster to
join with many other seafood restaurants and retailers in supporting
our Canadian Seafood Boycott campaign until Canada permanently ends
its seal slaughter.
<P>
This year, more than 300,000 harp seals--most under three months of
age, and many less than three-weeks-old--were bludgeoned or shot so
that their pelts could satisfy the frivolous whims of the fur
trinket, fur fashion, and exotic leather industries--industries which
thrive on ignorance, vanity, cruelty and greed. In 2001, a veterinary
panel studying the Canadian seal hunt concluded that in up to 42% of
cases they observed, the seals were likely skinned alive.
<P>
Why Boycott Canadian Seafood?
<BR>Seal hunting is an off-season activity conducted by fishers from
Canada's east coast. They earn a small fraction of their income from
sealing, and the rest from commercial seafood products such as snow
crabs. Canadian seafood exports to the United States contribute $3
billion annually to the Canadian economy--this dwarfs the few million
dollars of income generated by the seal hunt. Even in Newfoundland,
where 90% of sealers live, revenues from the seal hunt account for
less than 1% of the province's economy.
<P>
Our Canadian Seafood Boycott campaign is designed to force Canada's
fishing communities to choose between the small share of income they
make from sealing and the far larger share they make from exporting
seafood.
<P>
Why Red Lobster?
<BR>Red Lobster is the #1 seafood chain in the United States, and it is a
major importer of seafood from Canada. The connection between
Canada's seal hunt, commercial fishing industry, and Red Lobster as a
major purchaser of seafood gives Red Lobster and its customers the
power to bring Canada's cruel seal slaughter to an end.
<P>
To date, Red Lobster continues to sell Canadian seafood despite
repeated requests from Animal Alliance to join the boycott. Red
Lobster needs to hear from people in communities across Canada! We
need people in every community that has a Red Lobster to take a stand
against seal clubbers by joining our boycott campaign and ceasing to
purchase Canadian seafood until Canada ends the seal hunt once and
for all.
<P>
How You Can Help
<BR>Saturday, June 25th is Red Lobster Day of Action across North
America. We will encourage Red Lobster customers not to buy seafood
from Canada until the hunt ends, and we will let Red Lobster know
that the public cares about the seals and about Red Lobster's
purchasing decisions.
<P>
To make this day of action at Red Lobster restaurants a success, we
need your help. We need local activists to organize demos at Red
Lobster locations in their area.
<P>
Animal Alliance wants to make your role as an organizer as easy and
economical as possible. We can provide you with signs, banners and
leaflets. We can also provide media assistance, put you in touch with
other local activists, and provide you with any other help that you
may need.
