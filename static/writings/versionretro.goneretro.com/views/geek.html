For most historic analysts, the fifties was the start of a social revolution.  With the middle class and suburban population rising, kids suddenly had a lot of free time.  The "birth of the teenager" is very much talked-about, but was everyone really taking their boyfriends and girlfriends to the sock hop, or fornicating at Lookout Point?  Probably not.  What is usually overlooked is that not every adolescent fit into that youthful fun-loving mold.  Along with the birth of the teenager was the birth of the geek.
<P>
Geek Culture, as it shall be called, along with the term "Geekism", can be hard to describe.  The main attribute of Geekism is that it is synonymous with cult followings.  Geeks find pleasure in nonstandard activities that the mainstream public generally does not enjoy.  These activities usually require some level of brain power.  Basically, geeks have the most fun when they're having it intellectually.
<P>
From this follows other tell-tale characteristics.  Because geeks do not follow the norm, they are known for being social outcasts, who spend most of their time alone, or with a small group of others like themselves.  He's the one who'd rather blow his paychecks souping up his computer instead of his car.  She's the one who skipped her high school prom for the comic convention.  Since they don't pursue conventional trends, they can find refuge in each other since they are usually ostracized from the rest of their peers.  However, the feeling is mutual.  Geekism values originality and sincerity over faking it to look cool, and tends to be critical of popular culture.  Geeks may feel they are on a higher intellectual plane than the sheep around them, and a biting sarcastic wit is often present.  However, whether this bitterness comes from actual feelings of cerebral superiority, or resentment at not being invited to parties is anyone's guess.
<P>
Geeks can be arrogant in their belief that they are sharper and more genuine, but most people would never make this claim aloud.  Their sarcasm hides a shaky self-esteem that occasionally wonders why they don't belong.  They are generally unambitious and uncompetitive because of their reluctance to face challenges.  This is why the Geek may sit in front of the television set and make smart attacks on the ignorance of the government and the world, but would never lead any sort of campaign for change.  Thus, another advantage of being a geek: you can avoid your problems instead of confronting them.  Perhaps this is why Geek Culture has such a large following.  There are always individuals, who have difficulty keeping up with what's cool; who are intimidated by other people; who can't deny an antisocial hobby.  For them, it is much more preferable to retreat to the sanctuary of Geekism, which, as time progressed, was seen to go through a series of trends.
<P>
Probably the first fad to gain a cult following was the comic book craze.  The popularity of comics began to grow in the early twentieth century, and this was mainly because of the escape it could provide to the reader during hard times.  In the thirties, when the Depression bred horrific crime rates, detective comics like Dick Tracy were popular, while during the Second War, comics that featured superheroes, who always saved the day, were successful.  In fact, in most of the issues that were published during WW2, the villains were always tacitly connected to the Nazis, and invariably defeated .
<P>
After the war, when social issues were relatively more stable, comics remained.  For the kids who found no reassurance from their peers, comic books led them to another universe to which they could escape, and remain for a few hours completely disconnected from reality.  At that time, the teenager was still a fresh creation, and youths were not yet too different from everybody else.  However, in the early fifties, the first youth rebellion took place.  Adults had become aware of the escalation of comic books and charged that they depicted too much violence.  Comic fans, horrified at the possibility of losing their much-cherished picture stories, held on tightly while the major comic book publishers were put on trial.
<P>
Eventually, a regulation for comics was set up, and the battle was over .  Comic books were still made and sold, but public interest in the issue died down.  Geeks were once more out of the spotlight and forgotten, but they had made a lasting impact.  Youths were officially set on the opposite side of the establishment, and though it was unforeseen at the time, the comic book war was only a preview of the more intense teenage rebellions that would follow in the next decade.
<P>
As the geeks retreated back into the shadows, they began to spread beyond the realm of comic books.  The appeal of science-fiction they had discovered within the pages of pulp fiction continued to prosper.  Many television series of this genre were developed during this time.  "The Twilight Zone" was one of the first, running from 1959 to 1964.  Its storylines were very imaginative and fanciful, but somehow still plausible.  Their audience was confronted with plots ranging from time travel, to living dolls, to evil cameras.  The Twilight Zone wasn't able to reach the top of the television charts, but its huge cult following kept it from sinking to the bottom.  It was shown that its older viewers were professionals, such as doctors and lawyers, who had the academic background to perceive its bizarre situations.  However, the bulk of its fans were youths; in particular, geeks who loved the fantastic plots that were reminiscent of comic books, and who were open-minded enough to embrace this would-be clash of science and fiction .
<P>
Later on, Star Trek was created and became an immediate hit.  Its science-fiction settings relied heavily on actual findings in the physics community.  For the many geeks who were academically adept, they followed every technical explanation with awe.  It provided such exciting possibilities, while drawing from familiar mathematical concepts.  The geek embraced the escapism that allowed her to board a spaceship, warp space to arrive in a foreign galaxy that had different worlds to explore every episode.  Also, on Star Trek, the geek was no longer different from everybody else.  The entire crew was made up of brilliant scientists and physicists, and nobody ever called anyone else a nerd for being overly clever.  During the school day, the geek may be a loser, but on Star Trek, he, bunched with many other geeks, is suddenly a hero.
<P>
Outside the television screen, the real world's technology was also advancing, particularly electronic entertainment equipment.  Though programmers had already begun to experiment with various devices since the sixties, video game systems did not become popular until the mid-seventies when the Atari 2600 home video game system was released .  The technology of the games was relatively simple back then, but kids still devoured it.  The four on-screen colours would follow the movement of the joystick with the single button, giving the player a great sense of control.  This continued into the eighties, when games like Pong, Frogger, Asteroids and Space Invaders became classics .
<P>
Since then, video games have remained popular.  Constant technological improvements have allowed games to be more than just moving squares and dots, and many new genres have surfaced.  The most popular genre among the hardcore video game geeks is the role-playing genre.  In an RPG, (a role-playing game,) the player takes on the role of another character, usually of some remarkable status.  There is a storyline to start off, but the player is left to decide the fate of the chronicle.  There is the obvious geek-appeal of control, as well as escapism, in taking on the identity of another more heroic and adventurous character.
<P>
RPG's also exhibit other traits that strongly pull in a geek following.  Firstly, it is difficult for a player to not become obsessive, since picking up and creating a story requires more attention than some harebrained racing game.  It requires a relatively long time to finish, ranging from six to sixty hours.  Because of its addictiveness, most players feel compelled to engage in the game as much as possible, taking the time from areas that can afford to be downsized, (such as friends or sleep,) until they've finished the game.  This is not a problem for geeks, since they have never really reserved much time for these activities anyway.
<P>
It is also easy to become obsessive in a way that only a geek can obsess.  Many players have adopted a system where the first time they play the game, they try to finish it as quickly as possible.  The time it takes them to complete the game is compared to other players' times, and is used to determine one's RPG-superiority.  The player will then play the game a second time in a more articulate manner, scouring every corner and scrounging every object in the game.  The objective is to obtain a perfect score, irregardless of the time taken.  Usually, after this second run-through, the game is abandoned and may be played only for nostalgic purposes.  This system may seem frivolous to the average commentator, but for the detail-loving geek, personal satisfaction is achieved.
<P>
There is also another field that is really a branch from video games: the computer.  Since the time computers became affordable to the general public in the eighties, it was clear that it had 'geek' written all over it.  It had many of the qualities of video games that appealed to geeks: escapism and the ability to engulf you until you were completely obsessed with it.  There was a lot more though.  For one, it actually had intellectual requirements.  The multi-functional computer is more sophisticated than the video game system, and proved to be a delicious challenge to the cerebral power of the geek.  Even more alluring is the opportunity to program .  No longer was the geek confined to the structure that someone else had designed.  Surpassing even the freedom of RPG's, she could now write her own tale from start to finish.  The massive amount of detail, attention and creativity needed was more than enough to draw in a loyal following, not to mention the god-like powers the programmer obtains.  It was only natural that the computer became an instant love of the geek crowd, and even today, is able to keep its seductive spell.
<P>
It is ironic that the fads of originality and uniqueness have been strived for since the days of Conservative America in the 50's.  The bandwagon is constantly searching for something new, and has already found and dropped a multitude of trends, from glam to grunge.  Now, it's finally dipping into Geekism.  Today, the counter-mainstream aspect that had always defined Geek Culture has surprisingly changed.  To be a geek is suddenly trendy.
<P>
In the fashion world, funky thick-rimmed glasses with fake or no lenses are sold as accessories.  Runways at shows are flooded with plaids, chords, and loafers.  Of course, the designs usually have a suggestive twist, but what's important is that the plaid is still present.  High-end designers experimented with the style, with Marc Jacobs mixing grunge with plaid, Tommy Hilfiger bringing back fifties-style patterns, and Alexander McQueen doing collections that had girls in high-collared plaid shirts, ties, and kilt-like skirts .
<P>
Even the media has become a propeller of this movement.  On television, there are series such as Daria, which presents the world from the point of view of Daria, an over-achieving anti-social teenage girl with, of course, heavy glasses.  In the show, the football players and cheerleaders, who are usually the heroes of every high school, are portrayed as squeaky-voiced imbeciles who one would definitely not want to be like.  Daria will constantly criticize the ineffective way the school is run, but will never volunteer alternatives, with the excuse that she doesn't care.  The episode 'Prize Fighters' , in which she competes for an award, reveals that her intelligence is often stomped down by her lack of competitiveness.  Daria is insecure and slams her competitors by saying that they are being fake and sucking up, and then goes on to insult the sponsoring company.  The audience feels for Daria, whose passiveness and biting sarcasm correspond to the typical geek's distaste for the world and her low self-esteem that prevents her from trying to change anything.
<P>
Daria used to be a little show MTV ran on the side, but because of its rise in popularity, it is set to release its own movie this year.  To further illustrate the popularity of Geek Culture are many other movies that exalts social outcasts.  The one that comes to mind is "Mallrats", directed by Kevin Smith, who used to have a large cult following, but now, just has a large following.  The film's main character, Brodie, is the perfect loser.  He's in his twenties and lives in his parents' basement.  He has no job, doesn't go to school, was dumped by his girlfriend, plays video games, and reads comic books.  Of course, he is glorified by the movie.  His unmotivated slacker manner and offensive sarcasm add to the above list of reasons why he is hailed as a hero, and why so many Kevin Smith fans can relate to him.
<P>
Opposite the fictitious worlds of television and film lies the somewhat sincere poetry of the music industry.  As expected, they already have bands like Weezer to be ambassadors of this possibly-lucrative Geek Culture ready to be sold to the masses.  The members of Weezer are not particularly attractive.  Rivers, the lead singer, is short and dull, and has recently donned thick black-rimmed glasses.  Already, the geek is put at ease, with the knowledge that physical appeal is, thankfully, not very important.
<P>
Weezer is also awkward to interview.  During interviews, no matter how open-ended a question may be, the band's responses usually fall on 'sort-of's and 'I-don't-know's.  At the most recent Much Music interview in June 2001, when asked if they had an opinion on censorship, the band said "no".  When asked about how they felt when their video "Hash Pipe" was released in the States in a different version, featuring a cross-dressing skateboarder because of censorship laws, they replied "who cares" .  This sort of passiveness is even more apparent in their motto: 'If it's too loud, turn it down'.  This further reassures the geek that he is not in any danger of having to get up, as no kind of struggle will be necessary.
<P>
However, it's the lyrics of Weezer's songs that finally buys in the geek following.  Their songs express loneliness and insignificance.  For the most part, these are feelings that people would be able to relate to, much more than the self-glorification saturated in other popular music.  Instead of gloating about having 'money like Fort Knox' , Weezer will retreat to depressive brooding about being unpopularly different and isolated.  From time to time, they come out with pieces like "In the Garage".  In this particular anthem, Weezer sings about mastering Dungeons & Dragons, listening to Kiss and playing a guitar, hobbies that aren't exactly socially impressive.  However, the singer talks of indulging in these interests alone in his garage, where he is free of judgment and criticism .
<P>
Ultimately, this is the core of Geekism: self-indulgence.  Throughout the history of the geek, no matter how the world was, Geekism has always been about being true to oneself.  There was almost a Taoist mentality: the geek never followed the crowd, nor did he fight it; he just was.  Perhaps this is why today, Geekism is so revered: because it is one of the few things that are still genuine.  Even if sincerity was to be uncool next week, Geek Culture will never die, because there will always be outcasts in the world.  
<P>
It is invariable that these misfits of society will band together, and once they do, it won't matter that their clothes are all wrong, or that they can only lose their virginity to inanimate objects.  What's more important is the awareness that they are appreciated by others who understand what it's like.
