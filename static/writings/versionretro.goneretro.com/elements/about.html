<P>
So far this is the third major update.  If I keep with my last site's theme, this should be Version 3.0.  But because of the time trip, it will be <B>Version Retro</B>, (which is really idiotic.)
<P>
So that's the art. As for the person:
<P>
<B>Name:</B> Janet
<BR>
<B>Age:</B> Old enough.
<BR>
<B>Birthday:</B> Lincoln Day
<BR>
<B>Extra Notes:</B> I like artsy gays in their twenties.
<P>
And that's it...?  I don't really know what to say.
