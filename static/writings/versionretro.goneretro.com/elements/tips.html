<font size="3"><b>The Tips Log</b></FONT>
<P>
I'm a waitress, but I don't get tips. Not that I'm bad at what I do, I'm not supposed to. However, there are times when even I get lucky. And so the log begins.
<P><HR><P>
<B>Total to Date: $68.15</B>
<P>
<B>11th - 10/28/01 - $10.00</B>
<BR>One of the girls at work told me that she still owed me some money from the previous week (see below.) She gave me $10. I guess it was the latter after all.
<P>
<B>10th - 10/20/01 - $5.00</B>
<BR>It was almost the end of the season, and these two members wanted to show his appreciation (I guess.) They gave us $70 to split between the servers (I'm not sure if they meant ALL the servers employed or just the ones present that day.) I got $5 so I assumed it was the former. 
<P>
<B>9th - 10/18/01 - $25.00</B>
<BR>I arrived expecting a slow day and found the opposite. It turned out that there was a tournament, so I was kept pretty busy. The pro must have made a lot of money from that day because after everyone left, he gave all the servers $25 each.
<P>
<B>8th - 09/27/01 - $5.00</B>
<BR>You can read about it under 'Episodes' (entitled 'The Story of Janet's Eighth Tip'.)
<P>
<B>7th - 09/20/01 - $10.00</B>
<BR>At the end of the night, my boss called each of the servers in and gave us two fives each. The client who organized the dinner liked us that much. Woohoo!
<P>
<B>6th - 09/20/01 - $4.00</B>
<BR>Actually, it was only supposed to be for $3, but the cashier gave me $4 because he can't read.
<P>
<B>5th - 09/17/01 - $0.05</B>
<BR>You can read about it under 'Episodes' (entitled 'The Story of Janet's Fifth Tip'.)
<P>
<B>4th - 09/06/01 - $1</B>
<BR>Basically, I found it on a table I was clearing and took it. It was forgotten under a napkin, and everyone had left, so that justifies it.
<P>
<B>3rd - 08/30/01 - $3</B>
<BR>A woman ordered a $34 bottle of wine, and gave me her gold card. I wasn't sure how it worked, so I just gave the card to the guy at the cash register. He gave me a bill, on which he had written '$34'. I thought "Oh, that's how much they're paying, I guess I won't be getting a tip then." I presented the bill to the woman, with a slightly lower degree of enthusiasm. She looked at it, then wrote in a little box entitled 'TIP', a box that I had not noticed before. She had scribbled "$3". I ripped off the top, then took the bill back to the cash guy, and he took out three dollars from the register and gave it to me.
<P>
<B>2nd - 08/29/01 - $0.10</B>
<BR>You can read about it under 'Episodes' (entitled 'The Story of Janet's Second Tip'.)
<P>
<B>1st - 07/12/01 - $5</B>
<BR>Someone ordered a $35 bottle of wine. He gave me two twenties and muttered "Five is for you."
