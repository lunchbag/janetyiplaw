<font size="3"><b>Yoko Ono YES Art Gallery Exhibit</b>

On Tuesday, May 14 2002, I went to the Yoko Ono YES exhibit at the Art Gallery of Ontario with my Writer's Craft class.  What Yoko Ono has to do with creative writing is of course NOTHING, but so describes the foundation of the class.
<P>
I had really been looking forward to it, and had wanted to go see Ono herself on the opening day of the exhibit, (she was to hold a press conference and visit the gallery,) but could not.  I did not really care much for Ono, but I do hold the great John Lennon as a legend.  Meeting Ono would have been enchanting, in the same way that a meeting with Jesus Christ's cousin would be.
<P>
Anyways, it was a load of pretentious crap.  It's like that picture of coloured squares that could have been drawn by anyone's developmentally-delayed kid sister but sells for large amounts of money.  Hang it up in your room, and guests will say it's deep the same way they saw the emperor's new clothes.
<P>
With art though, the meaning does lie with the audience's own interpretation, but personally, I do not see this as a sign of merit in the artist.  A display of three spoons titled 'Four Spoons', next to a display of four spoons titled 'Three Spoons' may induce enlightenment in some viewer, but this in no way implies that Ono is a creative genius.
<P>
I did enjoy a movie piece of a famous performance by Ono, where she sits on the stage with a pair of scissors in front of her and invites the audience to come up and cut off a piece of her shirt while she remained silent, motionless and expressionless.  This was supposed to show the silence of victims of abuse, particularly women, and it was interesting in the end when a particular jerk in the audience decided to cut off her inner tank top and bra.  (Interesting not because of the near-nudity but because this is what actually happens in reality.)
<P>
Aside from that, there was not much unless if one was interested in Lennon-related significances.  Lennon had first been drawn to Ono after seeing one piece of a ladder leading up to a magnifying glass attached to the ceiling.  On the ceiling was written in small letters 'YES' (hence the title of the exhibit,) and Lennon later said that if the word had been 'NO', he would not have approached Ono.  Well this piece was there, as well as several reproductions of the "WAR IS OVER (if you want it)" billboard that he and Ono bought in several major cities.  Then, there were bed-in videos and pictures, which were quite fascinating and enjoyable because it was mostly Lennon (with a big shepherd's beard) talking with ono lying silently and adoringly by his side.  Yep, she was silent, and that was a big help.
<P>
To conclude, the exhibit made it clear that the greatest thing Ono did was marry Lennon.  I guess that's the greatest thing she did for herself.  The greatest thing she did for the world was interfere with the Beatles and really put a strain on one of the best bands in history.  Yes.
