<font size="3"><b>Air: "The Virgin Suicides" (Score) (2000)</b>
<BR>Virgin</font>
<P><HR width="50%" align="left"><P>
Most people would never listen to a movie score for pleasure, thinking that instrumentals are rightfully confined to the backdrop while a centerpiece story is told. However, Air's work for the movie The Virgin Suicides is as moving as the film. 
<P>
"Playground Love", the song-version of the main theme "Highschool Lover" is beautiful and if you can relate, you will cry. The instrumental tracks between the first and the last are as rich as fine chocolate. The common melodic line in "Bathroom Girl" and "Afternoon Sister" are dreamy and deserves its own single. Right before the end, you have the suspenseful "Dead Bodies" before the eerie "Suicide Underground", which tells the Virgins' story over that electronic-ambient-rock sound that Air is acclaimed for.

Essentials: "Playground Love", "Suicide Underground"
