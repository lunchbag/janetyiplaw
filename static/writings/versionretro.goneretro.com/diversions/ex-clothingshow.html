<font size="3"><b>The Clothing Show (Toronto)</b>
<BR>(05/12/02)</font>

I saw a short advertisement in the newspaper the Friday before the show and knew I had to be there.  This event only takes place for one weekend twice a year, once in May and once in October.  I'm not sure if it's exclusive to Toronto or not, but I have included the website link at the bottom for those who want to investigate it.
<P>
Anyways, if you can, go go GO!  Firstly, if you're the type who'd even consider a clothing event of any type, there is at least a small part of you that is yearning for some type of freedom or expression via dress.  The Clothing Show feeds this perfectly, be you one who would never actually wear anything but a sweatshirt, or one who has bank to spend on silly fishnet stockings.
<P>
The Clothing Show is essentially a huge flea market of clothing.  It takes place in the Exhibition building (in Toronto,) and is similar to that 'Around-the-World' market found every summer at the CNE.
<P>
I found that there were basically three types of booths:
<P>
<LI> <B>1. The Kensington-Market types.</B>  Kensington Market is a small area in downtown Toronto full of thrift stores.  The stuff is used, usually too big, and reeks of marijuana and human, but occasionally you find something cool.
<P>
<LI> <B>2. The Corporate Underground types.</B> This is stuff you might expect from Modrobes or West 49, where they push the image of an underground skater culture, but for $89.99 per pair of pants.  I avoided these tables as soon as I recognized them, which sometimes took more than a glance.  I did this mainly because I don't allow myself to spend more than $30 for a piece of clothing, shoes included.
<P>
<LI> <B>3. The Homemade types.</B> Oooh, THESE were the best.  I got the feeling that it was mostly twenty-somethings in school for art or nothing at all, and work lowly jobs, but design their own stuff in their basement studios.  Usually, they're sold for a lot of money, (or they're at least MARKED for a lot of money,) but at the show, it seemed that they were more about promotion rather than profit, and I got so much cool stuff, including a bright pink / white fuzzy hat for $5, from $65.
<P>
Anyways, in conclusion, it was a great great day, even if I was alone and even if it did help escalate a fight I was having with the D-Man.  But that's alright, because I got a cool bracelet for $3.
