Why did I buy this cd? 
Well "Flat Beat" (featured on the Levi's commercial) sounded cool, and the video was cute. 
That's pretty much it. The tracks on this cd is nothing more than monotonous beats and scratching. 
While it may be hypnotic to nod your head to or fade out in, paying $17 for a cd kind of buys the privilege of having something enjoyable and solid. If you want mindless noise, listen to your vacuum cleaner as you push it around the house. At least you'll get some work done.
