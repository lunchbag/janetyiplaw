Blink 182 has gotten a lot of crap since <I>Enema of the State</I>, when they sold out.  Well, listening to this album, I don't think I care.
<P>
Of course, there are some really stupid conformist non-conformist songs like "Give Me One Good Reason" that supposedly rebel against jock / preppy / goth trends, but salutes the punk kids who ditch school every day cuz they're the original ones.
<P>
However transparent this seems, this is the mentality of many of those who hate Blink.  It's obvious from many songs like "First Date", "Shut Up", "Stay Together for the Kids" that they're now targetting kids in their early-mid adolescence.  Now that this has been explicitly stated (by the band, not just by me,) why do we feel the need to rid the world of them?  Can't kids have their own exclusive bands to listen to?  Or do we expect them to make the jump from toddlerhood immediately to Barry Manilow (whom we will all be listening to one day)?
<P>
The majority of the album is very catchy, and although I consider myself a graduate of my teenage years, certain songs bring about happy nostalgia in me.  "First Date" is an absolutely sweet song, capturing the earnest loyalty of teenage romance, and it makes me cry to remember how we would pledge every effort to stay together when we know we can't ("This night's almost over... let's make this last forever... forever and ever...")
<P>
"Shut Up" is a stupid rebellious song (that is, it's about stupid kids who stupidly rebel against something stupid.)  I like it though, because it brings out the stupid rebellious side in me.  I guess that's the reason I like this whole album.  It's catchy and it's about stupid kids who stupidly rebel against something stupid.
<P>
Don't give them a hard time.
