Because of lead singer Gwen Stefani's quirky wild image, one either adores her, or thinks she's annoying.  I belong to the latter group, and No Doubt has always been a favourite group to hate. However, since the first time our store started playing it, I had to admit that this entire album is REALLY GOOD.  Described by the group themselves as a "party album", this release is less ska-noise and more infectious creative-pop.  There's experimentation with calypso on a few tracks, including "Start the Fire", in which the atmosphere is so effective, you start hearing bits about going to get "Delilah" cuz we're gonna need some "papaya".
<P>
Stefani projects an adorable convincing mood for each track.  The simple attitude of "Hella Good", bitter cheekiness of "Detective", summery hopefulness of "Don't Let Me Down" and earnest pleading of "Running" are all highlights of an already treat of an album.
<P>
Essentials: "Hella Good", "Detective", "Start the Fire", "Running"
