This cd is marvelous. It's the expected ska-punk that is full of catchy melodies that brings huge replay value. Ignoring the unimportant intro, "Bloodclot" opens as the catchiest and unamimously best song (especially with those "na-na-na's".) There's also a lot of reggae tones with songs like the title track and the closing "Coppers". "1998" is a somewhat angrier song but with a harsh sharp beat that still gets the head bopping, even if it is with a different mood. Also try Leicester Square and Lady Liberty, and pretty much the whole album for an addictive listening.

Essentials: "Bloodclot", "Life Won't Wait", "1998"
