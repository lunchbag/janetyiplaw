        Singer Spider One, being the younger brother of Rob Zombie, will invariably be compared to the shock/disgust-reliant metal act. While both siblings are indeed in the industrial-metal genre, Powerman 5000 seems to be composed of sci-fi geeks,
        rather than goth geeks. The whole album has an extraterrestrial theme which can be both interesting and annoying.
        While there are tracks that are based on the clich√©d alteration between eerie whisperings and mindless guitar riffs (ie the title track), songs like "Blast Off to Nowhere", featuring Rob Zombie and the brilliant single "When Worlds Collide"
        boost up the entire disc's appeal.
