I would like to thank everybody who played a part in my World Vision 30-Hour-Famine this year, participants and donors alike.  Between the six of the participants, we raised $395!  All of us will be receiving the frisbee prize.
<P>
For most of us, the famine started after our last decent meal on Thursday April 4th.  Because of my own unstable and unable health, I had encouraged everyone to not go on a full fast, but a bread-and-water diet instead.  The bread could be any type of bread - providing that it had no extras, (like cinnamon or raisons or honey garlic roast turkey.)  I would say Ian, Jacob, Jennifer and myself did pretty well on that.  Jennifer had mostly hot dog buns and an italian stick, Ian brought six slices of white bread for his lunch on Friday, while I showed up with an entire bag of Wonder bread, from which I offered Jacob three slices.  I discovered that psychology is pretty powerful... I had eaten ten pieces by ten o'clock in the morning - on most days, I wouldn't have eaten anything by then since the previous night's dinner.  But ten pieces it was and there was to be many more.

<P>
More impressively, Andrew and Dylan went on the complete hunger strike for about 36 hours.  Andrew appeared to carry himself very well, not showing a hint of weakness, though he did accuse me quite enthusiastically when I had some of Sheetal's pizza crusts, (which had NO tomato sauce or cheese or anything on them, but they seemed VERY delicious at the time.)
<P>
On the other hand, Dylan, (who is very fat,) showed plenty weakness.  By eleven o'clock Friday morning, he was already running like a madman toward the cafeteria.  Despite his desperate screams for a beef patty, he managed to get through it.
<P>
So there it is, I am very proud of and thankful to everybody involved!
<P>
