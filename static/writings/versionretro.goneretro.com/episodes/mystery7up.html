Yesterday was prom night, but Dylan and I didn't go because we went last year, and also, at the last minute, I decided that I hated all but ten people who would be at prom.  So we went downtown instead for our own mini-prom.  (Our mini-prom consisted of going to Bloor-Bathurst, looking at used videos, then walking all the way to Spadina-Queen.)
<P>
Well, there was this one Korean / Japanese restaurant across from the City TV building that we once passed and put on our list of places to visit.  We decided that that would be the day, so we went inside and had an excellent exotic meal with great service for only $25 for the two of us.  When we went back outside, we saw that the ground was wet but only felt a few drops of rain before they completely ceased.  We decided that it was a good day, and I decided that I was a lucky charm.
<P>
We started to head in the direction of Yonge-Queen for the subway station, and got about ten feet when we passed a huge truck with people handing out free 7-up cans.  It was the new promotional 7-up with pictures of a pineapple and cantelope slice beside the omnipresent lemon and lime slices.  It was a Thursday evening so I was surprised as I didn't think it was busy enough for such a promotional drive.
<P>
We were elated, not really because the 7-Up was a big deal but because it was such a good day with so many little pleasantries.  We put this in words after walking a block, and Dylan hugged me.
<P>
But...
<P>
I didn't feel the heavy clunk of the pop can.  I looked down and his hands were empty.  Where did the 7-Up go?
<P>
We both started to laugh but it wasn't long before Dylan's laugh became an uncomfortably-nervous one, and mine became an unbelieving-shocked laugh.  We went over the case:
<P>
<LI> He only had the 7-Up for maybe 2 minutes before it went missing.
<LI> He remembered holding it in his left hand, but suddenly it wasn't there anymore.
<LI> He couldn't have dropped it because it was a somewhat quiet night and we would've heard a sound.
<P>
We contemplated retracing our steps just to see if we could find a can rolling around on the ground.  We didn't care about the 7-Up, it was just so perplexing that it could have gone missing like that.  So we were going to go back, but then I saw a crazy homeless guy walking around and decided not to.
<P>
We finally arrived at the subway station, and entered the train.  We sat down and Dylan got this weird pained-ashamed look on his face like he had just broken his leg and was embarassed about it.  He shifted around and I decided that he was only being stupid again.  I looked away.
<P>
He pulled a warm shaken-up 7-Up can out of his ass.
<P>
We started laughing, but then I moved to another seat because he had been baiting me.  He continued to laugh hoping that I would start to, and he explained that he knew how much I enjoyed getting angry, and since the day was going so well and I had nothing to be angry about, he would give me something to be angry about.
<P>
We considered drinking the 7-Up, but it was too shaken up.  Later when we arrived at Finch Station, we opened it but it was disgustingly warm.
<P>
So we threw it away.
