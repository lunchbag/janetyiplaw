This was one of the funniest things that happened in my Robotics class last year, and even though I've told almost everyone I know this story, I think a lot would be wasted (and nothing would be learned,) if it didn't get secured into eternal words. 
<P>
Since Andrew and I are lazy people, we never felt like doing work in class, so we'd pass the time by telling each other the same jokes over and over again. At the time, the repetitiveness was what made it really funny. 
<P>
One day, he must've been reminded of something from his childhood, because he came in with that grade two joke: 
<P>
"Hey, what were you eating under there?" 
<BR>"Under where?" 
<BR>"HAHAHAHA, ewww you were eating underwear?! Hahahaha.." 
<P>
And then we'd laugh and it'd go on like that for a while. 
<P>
So one day, this guy Leroy* was walking past us, and Andrew flagged him down. He came over to us. 
<P>
"Hey, look under there!" said Andrew, pointing at a random spot. 
<P>
Leroy looked. "Under where?" he asked. 
<P>
"HAHAHAHA, you said underwear!!" said Andrew delightfully. 
<P>
Leroy looked confused for a second, and then a light visibly came on. "Ohh!! I get it! Hmmm.... I'll get you back... I'll think of something..." he said deviously, walking away. 
<P>
Five minutes later, Leroy returns. "Hey Andrew! Look over there!" 
<P>
"Over where?" asked Andrew. 
<P>
"Ohhh!! You said - hey wait a minute... argh damnit!" Leroy walked away, frustrated.
