On Wednesday, I received my second tip from my non-tipping waitressing job. (My first tip was a few weeks earlier, it was $5 for a $35 bottle of wine; my third tip was yesterday, $3 for a $34 bottle of wine. But that's not the story here.) 
<P>
We were closing, and I was aimlessly walking around, tired from the ten-hour work day I was subjected to. 
<P>
The cleaning lady, (a very sweet woman with whom I had conversed with earlier that day,) was vacuuming. While she was doing so, she found a dime on the floor. 
<P>
Well, now you can guess where this is heading. 
<P>
She put it in my apron pocket and said "A tip for you, sweetie." 
<P>
I didn't forget to say thanks.
