<i>(02/08/02)</i>
<BR>Is anyone keeping count? I am. I present to you, <B>Version Retro</B>, the third major edition of <I>Werld of Love</I>, my ongoing collection of writing.
<P>
The theme I'm currently exploring is pretty obvious. In my 20th Century World History class, I really took in Mullen's enthusiastic retelling of the sixties.  The original style was supposed to be psychadelia, as shown by the splash image. However, it was too hard to make graphics for, so I instead moved forward a decade.  I guess it was also because I wanted to use cool retro circles.
<P>
So here it is, I hope you enjoy this as much as I do, Janet.

Added another batch of logs and a story (under <I>Episodes</I>), a CD review of Blink 182's <I>Take Off Your Pants and Jacet</I> CD (under <I>Diversions</I>), added a quotation (under <I>Elements</I>.)
<P>
More importantly though, my first 'children's book' has been published!  <a href="hungry/index.html" target="_new"><B>Mr. Hungry</B></A> is now available online, exclusively on this website!  Anyone interested in linking it is welcome to, but please tell me first and don't steal svp.

<P>
And still no word on that altered-states column.

<B>Mind-Altered States</B> <I>(02/08/02)</I>
<BR>A friend of mine has been experimenting with various mind-altering drugs lately. Though I do not endorse drug abuse at all, I am very intrigued by it, especially with my recent discovery of the sixties.
<P>
I've been asking him a lot of questions about the experience, and he has described his feelings to me directly while he was high. What I will probably do is try to organize the things he told me into a little piece, which should be out soon.
