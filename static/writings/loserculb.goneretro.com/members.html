<B>Anjo</B>
<BR>He's too busy for the Culb because of his constant volunteering.  What happened to you man?  You used to be cool.
<P>
<B>fank</B>
<BR>He looks like <A HREF="http://www.moby.com" TARGET="_new">Moby</A> with <A HREF="http://www.eminem.com" TARGET="_new">Eminem</A> hair, so fans of both artists hate him.
<P>
<B>Ian</B>
<BR>He has promised to voluntarily run the Culb during "off-season", which is every four months when he's out of school.  He volunteered, just like he willfully signed up to be a member in the first place.

<B>Janet</B>
<BR>Since she moved back to Toronto, she reads trashy articles on the internet during the day and plays <I>SimCity 3000</I> every Saturday night.

<B>TKO</B>
<BR>If you catch his attention in any way, he's gonna freeze you like Mr. Freeze does, after mailing you killer bats like Batman does.
