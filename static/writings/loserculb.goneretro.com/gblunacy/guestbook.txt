<div class="viewGuestbook"><FONT SIZE=3><B>So...</FONT><BR>January 2, 2004</B><BR><I>10:05 am</I><P>So I woke up and came to work about 20 minutes late. It was snowing. Heavily. All I could think about was my warm warm bed. And the pain in my shoulders, tailbone, and knees. And I came to work. But there weren't many people. No one in my branch. About 3 people on the entire floor. And so I thought that if no one shows up before noon, I'm just going home. That became 11:30. Then 11:00. Now I'm sitting here alone thinking that if no one from my branch shows up within half an hour, I'm headed home. Okay, 20 minutes. Okay, I'm going to start packing up. <P>-- <I>TKO</I></div><P><CENTER>* * * * *</CENTER><P>
<div class="viewGuestbook"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Boredom is a painfully human phenomenon only replicated in human pets.</FONT><BR>August 15, 2003</B><BR><I>6:06 am</I><P>So after 12 hours of living like an Amish dude, I decided I don't really like it. In complete darkness and pretty much complete silence as well, I laid in my bed for hours trying to get sleep. I hate not being able to get to sleep. It seems to have gotten to this horrible level from the first little bit of living at waterloo spring term. For probably the 30th time in a few months, I tried counting sheep. I got past 1000 and gave up as I often do.<br><br>Then the power came back on. I immediately turned on my computer and TV and realized... drumroll... I still don't really have anything worth doing. Not just because it's night either. I spent Wednesday and Thursday back home without anything to do.<br><br>Now I'm posting on this. Because I'm bored. <br><br>Later today I have to start searching for Ottawa housing. I finally plan on doing it with but a few weeks left. <br><br>Oh yeah, I plan on buying sleeping pills soon. I don't imagine myself getting addicted because I haven't gotten addicted to any other drugs in the past. However, there is a slight fear that if suddenly I can just get to sleep, well yay. And then I'll become dependent on it permanently.<br><br>Also, I'm going to buy a bunch of <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books-ca&field-author=Palahniuk%2C%20Chuck/701-6414349-6350705" target="_black">Chuck Palahniuk</a> books. <a href="http://www.futureshop.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp?logon=&langid=EN&dept=0&WLBS=fsweb9&sku_id=0665000FSM1889243&catid=&newdeptid=13" target="_black">Fight Club</a> the incredible movie made me download and read <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805062971/qid=1060939963/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_3_1/701-6414349-6350705" target="_black">Fight Club</a> the incredible book and now I'm going to buy and read most of his books.

<div class="viewGuestbook"><FONT SIZE=3><B>So... What'd you do this past June?</FONT><BR>June 30, 2003</B><BR><I>4:32 pm</I><P>Apparently I've completely left The Loser Culb idle for all of June, and half of May. Sorry guys, work is just so taxing that I hardly have time to do or care about anything else.<br><br>I did start my own personal web log recently, on xanga.com. Follow here <a href="http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=billpo">http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=billpo</a>.<br><br>It details my current involvement with porting a game that was not intended for the Mac, to the Mac. Fucking game. There's almost 400 source files alone (.cpp not .h) and god only knows how many more header files and script files. This entire game was not developed too well for portability either and its mac port is getting delayed and delayed again because of really horrible and obscure bugs that are a result of this poor planning. On top of that alt.software has very limited experience porting games to the mac, with only one developer who specializes in this area.<br><br>Speaking of this one developer, he recently stopped working on this game because he spent 15 days trying to fix a bug before GIVING UP. Geez. I managed to fix it in less than 4 days, but it looks like my fix might not have been the actual problem. Or rather, my fix makes sense, but the error still exists in the original PC code but the bug isn't there in the PC version... so, what the hell.<br><br>I'm the only one currently working on this project and its so huge that all I can manage to do is feel extremely overwhelmed, fix a small bug, prepare my next debugging plan of action for the next day, and worry about the overall state of this game as I get deeper and deeper into the horrible hacked code I'm creating that diverges way to far from the PC code to be good. Its a very bad sign that so many bugs pop up on the Mac version that are still there in the code on the PC, but cause no problems. I want to kick my face.<br><br>So that's been most of my June. Actually, that was about half my June. The other half I was sick with what was first a nasty cold, and then 5 days later turned into a horribly painful ear infection. I hadn't had an ear infection before then since I was 2 or 3 years old!!<br><br>Sigh... well, gotta get back to wrecking, *ahem* I mean fixing, this mac port.<br><br>Oh the game is called Celtic Kings btw, if you want to look it up. It was developed by some Bulgarian company, which I find rather funny, since they happened to have the misfortune of choosing alt.software to do their mac port. They're like the poor foreign kid who becomes friends with the biggest loser at school, but instead of having a happy ending like most tv shows and movies would have, this company is just suffering the consequences. Maybe they didn't choose us though, could have been the publisher. I dunno. <P>-- <I>Ian</I></div><P><CENTER>* * * * *</CENTER><P>

He was telling the guy on the other end about the input on Port C, listing what each pin is. I wrote the document that listed all this information and my boss is reading off of that doc. As he listed each pin - they are for sensor data from a set of 4 pistons - he starts saying "pin 11 is 3B, pin 13 is 3A, pin 15 is 2B..." and I feel a sense of pride and accomplishment cause its my document.

Or rather that people do infact enjoy sex, and so its silly to pretend that people don't have sex. You parents for example. Its a horrifying image, but it happens, so deal with it. Anyway, young people enjoy sex too, so telling them they can't have it will only hurt them cause they'll end up doing something stupid on their own. Like have sex in a club, or alley, or park, or whatever.<br><br>I point you to this article that details how one man understands this idea very well while everyone else would just like him to go away so they can continue to ignore their problems in life.<br><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,954998,00.html">http://www.guardian.co.uk/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,954998,00.html</a><br><br>So yeah, apparently this is what a programmer, er sorry, Software Engineer does at work.

It's sad because I love the work I do (programming) but at the same time I hate that its so exhausting and time consuming, and drags me away from family and friends.<br><br>I haven't talked to the majority of my friends for more than 10 minutes since work started and when they do appear online, they end up not being at their computer. Unless they're ignoring me, which I always end up wondering when ever i'm left to this lengthy solitary state. I know that its not true and that they are all probably busy with their own problems and things, but still, I want attention! I want to give attention! I want to spend time and do things with people!<br>Hell, I need a girlfriend, but I'm in way to desperate a state that I'd just freak out who ever I asked<br><br>So tired<br>Its only 9:30 and I want to go to bed. Ah well, on the bright side this weekend is a long weekend. And Janet invited me to come visit her and tausif at waterloo, so even if I can't make it I greatly appreciate that there are people who want my company<br><br>Further on the bright side I'm seeing the FIRST showing of the matrix, tomorrow, may 14th at 10pm!!

"Obviously, English isn't their first language."<br><br>In a project intended more as performance art than scientific experiment, faculty and students in the university's media program left a computer in the monkey enclosure at Paignton Zoo in southwest England, home to six Sulawesi crested macaques.<br><br>Then, they waited.<br><br>At first, said Phillips, "the lead male got a stone and started bashing the hell out of it.<br><br>"Another thing they were interested in was in defecating and urinating all over the keyboard," added Phillips, who runs the university's Institute of Digital Arts and Technologies.<br><br>Eventually, the monkeys produced five pages of text, composed primarily of the letter S; later, the letters A, J, L and M crept in.<br><br>The notion that monkeys typing at random will eventually produce literature is often attributed to Thomas Huxley, a 19th-century scientist who supported Charles Darwin's theories of evolution. Mathematicians have also used it to illustrate concepts of chance.<br><br>The Plymouth experiment was funded by England's Arts Council and part of the Vivaria Project, which plans to install computers in zoos across Europe to study differences between animal and artificial life.<br><br>Phillips said the results showed that monkeys "are not random generators. They're more complex than that.<br><br>"They were quite interested in the screen, and they saw that when they typed a letter, something happened. There was a level of intention there."<br> <P>-- <I>Janet</I></div><P><CENTER>* * * * *</CENTER><P><div class="viewGuestbook"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Oh yeah, and why am I still posting on the LoserCulb even though I'm off work now?</FONT><BR>May 10, 2003</B><BR><I>8:07 pm</I><P>Because I'm a loser!<br><br>Yeah!! <P>-- <I>Janet</I></div><P><CENTER>* * * * *</CENTER><P><div class="viewGuestbook"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Discovering the Loopholes that Come with Corporations</FONT><BR>May 10, 2003</B><BR><I>8:03 pm</I><P>Now, when I got my last co-op job, I was to get $500 a week.

(Note, BillPo is me)<br> <br><i>BillPo:</i> debugging using only a console print function, along with it not being able to print new line characters, inaddition to having to download the exe to the embedded computer that i'm testing on everytime i rebuild really really really really fucking sucks<br><br><i>BillPo:</i> oh, i forgot to mention that the exe is transferred over a serial port connection, so it takes over half a minute to transfer the 110k file <br><br><i>TKO:</i> hahaha<br><br><i>BillPo:</i> ahhhhhhh, i found a bug.

Also, Chretien is the leader of a country whose trade relies almost entirely on the States, I can't see how anyone could realistically expect him to express any negative sentiments against the US.  However, many of his senior aides have voiced THEIR anti-american sentiments, and Chretien has been urged to fire them immediately, but he remains firm in his stance that they be allowed to voice their opinions.  That is impressive.  A Canadian prime minister who speaks out aganist the US the way you think would be impressive would have long run the country to the ground. <P>-- <I>Janet</I></div><P><CENTER>* * * * *</CENTER><P><div class="viewGuestbook"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Disgruntled Goat</FONT><BR>April 11, 2003</B><BR><I>3:38 pm</I><P>Chretien's little talks all basically represent the opinions of Canadians who inevitabley won't make a difference. Rather than getting involved (and having some decent influence instead of being an outsider) with the cleanup and creation of a livable society in Iraq, he chose to avoid it all together. Now when American leaves as their public support fades, Iraqis will be screwed. Just like the story of the one Iraqi who helped out the American military in locating his oppressors...<br>The military had to leave that town and a few days later he was shot and the town taken back.<br><br>But I guess that's part of Chretiens continued plan to isolate Canada from actually having to do any work in the world and instead just take all the credit because of what Canada has done in the past. We went from doing 10% of the world's peace keeping with less than 1% of the population to now, not even covering our share. Oh well, the Canadian economy will prosper in comparison to America's, while Chretien is being as anti-american as tolerable.<br><br>i'll be impressed with Chretien's anti-american comments when he says something substantial about about the loss of American civil liberties and the impact it will have on the rest of the world. Or, maybe, just maybe, he could point out the disregard for human rights in America where they have the largest prison population in the world and approximately 1 in 8 black adult males is in prison. Not to mention the daily rapings and disgusting quality of those prisons. When Chretien stands up and says something real like that, then I'll be impressed.

<br>No, the liberals are not perfect either. However, following the impressive actions of Jean Chretien in the news these recent times has really inspired me and I think that the Liberals can be saved.

<br>The third world war will start when the US fucks with China.  The Americans will probably try to affix some kind of shame to being an Oriental, like they have with being Muslim or brown in general.

<br>I haven\'t 
<br>-done much in Toronto but wouldn\'t say that I haven\'t had any fun
<br>-learned C++ despite my desperate need to do so
<br>-gotten nice and high because I\'ve had to wait on sources that I trust
<br>-watched the plethora of movies I have downloaded
<br>-listened to the plethora of songs I have downloaded and want to listen to
<br>-used the word plethora exactly 3 times every day
<br>-figured out when people are talking out loud to themselves or talking to me
<br>-gotten back to being able to live on 2-4 hours of sleep a night like I did in high school
<br>-joined a cult
<br>-quit a cult
<br>-exposed secrets of a cult
<br>-been hunted down by a cult, captured and reprogrammed
<br>-deprogrammed myself after being captured by a cult
<br>-started my own cult, a fantasmal experiment in brainwashing
<br>-ended my own cult because I only had 3 followers and those 3 followers kind of scared me
<br>-had really cool dreams apart from the one I had last night
<br>
<br>I dreamt that Britain was upset with the way the war in Iraq was going and generally agreed with the rest of Europe that America needed to stop consistently acting unilaterally with global consequences. So after years of secret planning, they shocked the world by attacking America and there I watched in awe as a world war broke out drenched in American propaganda. As America started defending itself adequately, countries like Pakistan joined in and one by one launched surprise attacks on America. I woke up before I saw an overall outcome as both sides were pretty evenly matched with Canada scared to do anything. When I woke up, I thought to myself \"Why doesn\'t anything worthwhile like this ever happen in real life? Instead I\'m stuck living in such a boring time in the world where the biggest event is that 3,000 American\'s died so they want retaliation meanwhile so much other crap happens and no one ever wants to fight back or start a revolution.\" And just like that, boredom is compounded upon itself. <P>-- <I>TKO</I></div><P><CENTER>* * * * *</CENTER><P>

<div class="viewGuestbook"><FONT SIZE=3><B>The Hours</FONT><BR>April 11, 2003</B><BR><I>8:38 am</I><P>\"The Hours\" was a very much acclaimed movie but the synopsis, which I forget, sounded boring. I did not watch any awards shows, but Catherine Zeta Jones seems to be a really good actor, if you base it on the number of acting awards she\'s won.
<br>
<br>I guess this kind of makes up for her stupid feud with that magazine. I\'m talking about the lawsuit she and Michael Douglas are launching against a tabloid for publishing unauthorized photos of their wedding. Apparently, they had been violated because they had sold the photographing rights to a rival magazine, AND what\'s more, the unauthorized photos of Zeta Jones eating cake \"made her look fat\".
<br>
<br>I first saw Zeta Jones in movie remake \"The Haunting\" which was stupid but had great effects. I thought she was pretty good (despite the poor script,) and then she appeared in some romantic comedy later on in which every audience was amazed at her \"stunning aesthetic beauty\". It\'s just kind of amusing to watch her carry out the archetype of Evil Whiny Spoiled Celebrity. <P>-- <I>Janet</I></div><P><CENTER>* * * * *</CENTER><P>

<br>And a big square dot.

<br>I\'ve been administering, doing tech support and setting up computers as per normal. Today things get a little different though. I get to do actual software testing. The next step towards development (since I\'m not Ian and am generally following a normal path).
