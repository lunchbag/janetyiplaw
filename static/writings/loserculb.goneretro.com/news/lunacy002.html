<p>Also, the 2 people who do read this are obviously bored enough to search for the new post, but the millions of others aren't. So blame the lack of popularity of this on that. Yeah, that makes sense. Anyways, how about you just run a little script that sorts by date every now and then. You could also put an indicator on the news page that shows the date and time of the last post.</p><P><I>-- TKO</I></FONT><P><CENTER>*   *   *   *   *</CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=Arial><FONT SIZE=3><B>Idea as to the possible problem</B></FONT><BR><B>April 7, 2003</B><BR><I>11:07 am</I><P><p>I've noticed that it takes a little while before my post will show up and I don't think that's because of browser caching issues. I've also noticed, that you started getting problems when posts were being added close to the same time. So that looks to me like the possible cause. If it is, then that suggests your web host sucks and you may need to create a little buffer script that would store the last 5 minutes or so worth of posts to a text file, then add all posts in that text file to the database, and those damn buffer scripts are always bloody annoying.</p><P><I>-- TKO</I></FONT><P><CENTER>*   *   *   *   *</CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=Arial><FONT SIZE=3><B>I HATE THIS DATABASE</B></FONT><BR><B>April 4, 2003</B><BR><I>9:42 am</I><P>I HATE THISTK:DJF<P><I>-- Janet</I></FONT><P><CENTER>*   *   *   *   *</CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=Arial><FONT SIZE=3><B>Test</B></FONT><BR><B>April 4, 2003</B><BR><I>1:12 pm</I><P><p>This is a test, just to see where the log ends up.

<p>Hey, with posts ending up anywhere on the page with neither rhyme nor reason, this lunacy we speak of truly is random.

By the way, your 'challenge' to not touch the floor reminded me of that Mission Impossible scene where Cruise is hanging in that room.<P><I>-- Janet</I></FONT><P><CENTER>*   *   *   *   *</CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=Arial><FONT SIZE=3><B>Donnie Darko</B></FONT><BR><B>April 3, 2003</B><BR><I>2:01 pm</I><P><p>I think Donnie Darko is one of those movies that's being downloaded from kazaa as I type.

I will henceforth (except when other people are around) not allow my feet to touch the ground in the server room. This means that all movement must be done via chair and when I need to get something high, I either stand on the chair or it's, um, wheel things at the bottom.</p> <P><I>-- TKO</I></FONT><P><CENTER>*   *   *   *   *</CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=Arial><FONT SIZE=3><B>Ugh</B></FONT><BR><B>April 3, 2003</B><BR><I>4:36 pm</I><P><p>If I wasn't worried that someone would come in and see me not doing anything, I could sit here staring at a wall for hours and be perfectly content.

But then the end comes and it makes even less sense.  So then you'd either be really frustrated cuz you'd think that the movie's smarter than you, OR you'd write the movie off as some stupid pretentious YokoOno type movie.
<P>
I think I was a bit of both when I saw it, but then I went on the internet and looked up all sorts of explanations.  Now I feel that I need to watch it a second time.
<P>
I've never been able to download a full length 90 minute movie, or full-length game.  EVER.  (Well, except for crappy romantic comedies on the university network.)
<P>
You actually helped me out with my "work dilemma".  I'm now under the guise of "working on my work report", which sounds professional.  So now I have two weeks of 8-hour-days to work on my work report.  I'm mostly going to just play on the internet though.<P><I>-- Janet</I></FONT><A NAME=bottom><P><HR><P><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=3><B>lunacy</B></FONT><P><FONT FACE=Arial SIZE=2>Click <A HREF=lunacy_add.php>here</A> to add an entry.</FONT><P><P>And that's the end.<P></BODY></HTML>
