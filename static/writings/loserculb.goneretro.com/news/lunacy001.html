I had thought that you were actually going to start joining all the clubs.  I went to that one meeting of Food Not Bombs, and the people there were such poster-loser-geeks, it was so funny.  Like there was this girl, who was short and seemed very nice and caring about social issues and all, and sincerely laughed at every little joke, and toke notes with her little tongue poking out of the side of her mouth.  And there was this guy who was small and skinny, into social issues, and made lots of little mild jokes that the girl laughed at.  Then there was the hot girl who was just there for the credit or something, and the immigrant girl who was quiet the whole meeting.

You have conversations with Elastic the plastic onion. Conversations manage to turn into arguments. Elastic the plastic onion always wins these arguments. So you get pissed off at Elastic the plastic onion. Then you get sick of Elastic the plastic onion so you throw out Elastic the plastic onion. A day or so later as you're taking out the garbage, you notice that Elastic the plastic onion is there and you start to think of all the good times you had with Elastic the plastic onion. But those times are over. And so Elastic the plastic onion is forgotten until one day, decades from now, you're eating onion rings and once more you remember the good times you had with that old plastic onion. So you start wearing an onion on a piece of string around your neck as a pathetic necklace. This new onion is made of a futuristic material. You name this new onion falamenalangelo the futuristic space onion. Or Elastic the second onion for short. Eventually, you're buried with Elastic the second onion. Your tombstone will then refer to your strange onion obsession. People passing by will wonder about how one person could be so obsessed with onions.

On top of everything, I haven't been very nice to him. We've talked and I've apologized and am working on it, but now he's not sure he can handle a relationship on top of the stress.

However, the other part of him loves me, thinks we have a great thing together (if we can get through this!) and doesn't want to throw it away. I have very limited options. He knows I'm sorry for taking my stress out on him, I love him and want to get through this, but I can't do much more (and frankly don't have the emotional resources right now to handle this).

So, a step back is called for, yes? I hate feeling needy with him. Do you think we have a chance to make things better or does it sound like we're just not in the right relationship?

Stepping Back?

<P>&nbsp;<P>
DEAR STEPPING: Question for you. How hard is it to be kind to someone?

A step back is called for here, not because you're both too stressed out to "handle a relationship,'' but because you're not ready for one if you can't stay glued when you're tense. Honestly, horrible arely is, and always passes.

I don't say this to diminish the emotional or even physical impact of stress. It's real, documented, huge. 
<P>
But it doesn't constitute licence to beat up on people around you, nor is apologizing afterward sufficient to make things okay. When snappish behaviour is the exception, maybe &#8212; but not when it's your current operating mode because you lack more productive ways to cope. 
<P>
One of which, by the way, is kindness to people you love. It's not even something you need to "work on'' or tap resources for. You just do it. It's as good for you as it is for the people around you. It's the anti-stress.
<P>
As is perspective. As is kindness to yourself. As is taking a break from the things that upset you, or seeking even the briefest refuge in a select few things that don't. 
<P>
If your boyfriend is the former and not the latter, that's another vote for time off &#8212; but if you like to be with him, try not ``working on'' that, either. Just get over yourself, and do it.<P><I>-- The Star Article</I></FONT><P><CENTER>*   *   *   *   *</CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=Arial><FONT SIZE=3><B>Iraq</B></FONT><BR><B>March 24, 2003</B><BR><I>7:09 pm</I><P>Well.
