I am tired of all you athiestic evilutionists spreading your satanic lies all over the internet.  God created the Earth from corner to corner, both sides and thats a fact.  If it weren't true, how can you explain these facts?
<P>
Evilutionists say humans evolved from monkeys by a random accident. Well lets look at the facts.  My friend had a monkey and the day it died it didn't look any more like a human then the day it was birthed.  I even asked a guy I know who is an evilutionist and an agnastic what was the probability that a couple of monkeys could have a human baby and he said none.  So then I said that if you take that probabillity and add it to the probability that all the other monkeys would have human babies you still have none and that shows that the laws of statistics disprove evilution.  He was so impressed by this logic that he couldn't even argue, he just fell down and convulsed on the floor, just like we do at church so I know he found Jesus that day.
<P>
Evilutionists say that we know that humans came from monkeys because we look alike.  Well, my son looks just like the mail man and they ain't related. That proves that humans din't come from monkeys.
<P>
The evilutionists say that fossiles show the changes from monkey to man, but then if you ask if they have fossiles between the fossiles that they have they have to admit that they don't but they try to change the subject and tell you that Elliot Jay Gould has a puncturated eardrum that affects his equilibrium so you know they are lying.
<P>
I know that the Creationists are right because my church even gave them an award and everyone clapped and it is a big church with over 10,000 worshippers. I was so happy I gave them an extra 5$ even though that was money for my son's lunch and when he cried I told him that is was better he should go hungrey for another day if that kept the governmint from forcing us to teach evilution in our home school so he could get as smart as me.
<P>
But if these true facts don't make you stop worshiping Darwin, I will tell you somthing that will make you stop preaching Satanism on the Internet.  I just heard on the Christian radio station that evilution is against the second law of thermodynamites.  I am giving you fair warning that if you post any more evilution I will forward your writing to the FBI and I am sure they will not be laughing. This will be your only warning.
