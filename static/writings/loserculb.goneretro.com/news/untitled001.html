If you're happy and you know it bomb Iraq 
<BR>If you cannot find Osama, bomb Iraq. 
<BR>If the terrorists are frisky, Pakistan is looking shifty, 
<BR>North Korea is too risky, Bomb Iraq. 
<P>
It's "pre-emptive non-aggression", bomb Iraq. 
<BR>Let's prevent this mass destruction, bomb Iraq. 
<BR>They've got weapons we can't see, and that's good enough for me 
<BR>'Cos it's all the proof I need, so Bomb Iraq. 
<P>
If you never were elected, bomb Iraq. 
<BR>If your mood is quite dejected, bomb Iraq. 
<BR>If you think Saddam's gone mad, With the weapons that he had, 
<BR>(And he tried to kill your dad), then Bomb Iraq. 
<P>
If your corporate fraud is growing, bomb Iraq. 
<BR>If your ties to it are showing, bomb Iraq. 
<BR>If your politics are sleazy, And hiding that ain't easy, 
<BR>And your stomach's getting queasy, Bomb Iraq. 
<P>
If we have no allies with us, bomb Iraq. 
<BR>If we think someone has 'dissed' us, bomb Iraq. 
<BR>So to hell with the inspections, Let's look tough for the elections, 
<BR>Close your mind and take directions, Bomb Iraq. 
<P>
Fall in line and follow orders, bomb Iraq. 
<BR>For our might knows not our borders, bomb Iraq. 
<BR>Disagree? We'll call it treason, Let's make war not love this season, 
<BR>Even if we have no reason, Bomb Iraq.
