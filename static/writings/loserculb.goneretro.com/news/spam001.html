Hello, 
<P>
Here is a work-boredom log:

This message to all of you comes after realizing that it's become the sole form of direct communication between me and Tausif alone, (outside of already-direct-and-much-used icq).  ... anyway, why don't you all join in the fun?  We already pretend that we are communicating to mass audiences.  Let's make it happen (because seven people = the masses.) 
<P>
I did the programming myself, so don't exploit it and don't try to hack it, and if you use tags, remember to close them all, and you need to use paragraph tags.  That means every time you write something and you want to skip a line, you must type "(P)".  Also, oldest entries are displayed first.  It's annoying.  This is because I do not know how to program. 
<P>
Thank you, and have a good day.
