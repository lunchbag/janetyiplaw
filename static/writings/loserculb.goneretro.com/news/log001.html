Some of the stuff we talked about on icq is good, but I'm at work and using that portable icq program, and so is Tausif. That means even if Tausif has the history turned on, he can't copy-and-paste, or even select text. In the end, we decided that he was going to take screenshots of the history and email them to me, and I'll retype it. Yep. 
<P>
But basically, it seems like Ian and Tausif are keen on the ideas of The Loser Culb and The Dirty Thief Club. The Loser Culb will be about being pathetic and spineless, and The Dirty Thief Club will be about being bastards and jerks. We are planning for them to be partners, and we imagine for them to have various territorial feuds in the future. The DTC will mercilessly taunt the LC, and the LC will have insults that vaguely make sense but don't. 
<P>
Originally, I was just going to put together a "Loser Fish Club", because fish are funny. But then Tausif pointed out that the word 'fish' can have other connotations, which he didn't mind, but I did. So after going through a bunch of his suggestions, including "Black Rebel Losers Club", "Losers Fake Motorcycle Club", "Losers Run Slide Club, and "Uniciders Anonymous", we settled on a short-and-simple "The Club", or better yet, "The Culb". 
<P><I>-- Janet</I></FONT><P><CENTER>*   *   *   *   *</CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=Arial><FONT SIZE=3><B>Further Developments</B></FONT><BR><B>Feb 26, 2003</B><BR><I>9:47 AM</I><P>After sleeping on it, I'm starting to see how the name "The Dirty Thief Club" really doesn't fit the group's intention of being jerks.  I still like it though.
<P>
I've also got these great ideas that we can do with the Loser Culb and the DTC.  One is that from time to time, one group will "hack" the other's website and post humiliating secrets.  It'll stay up for a day or two, after which the victim will post an apology and explanation that it had been hacked, but that "its security breach was now fixed".  A copy and record of the hacked page can be found on the attackers' site, while the victim will maintain a record.  IE: 
<LI>Feb 28: Culb founded.  
<LI>Mar 5: Culb pizza party.  
<LI>Mar 10: Culb website hacked.  
<LI>Mar 15: Culb website restored. Hacker found to be those dirty thieves from the Dirty Thief Club.  
<LI>Mar 20: Culb bowling trip.  
<LI>Mar 25: Culb hacks DTC website.  
<LI>Mar 25: DTC website restored.
<LI>Apr 3: Culb website hacked...
<P>
So as mentioned before, many good ideas sprang from yesterday's online conversations with Ian and Tausif.  However, I had to go to the dentist last night.  My mother came in and chatted with the dentist, causing the dentist to (accidentally or otherwise) make my entire set of gums bleed.  As a result, I got home a bit later, and I did not even turn on my laptop last night.  However, my brief affair with normal life is over, and I once again swear my loyalty to my computer.
<P>
So what that really means is that I did not get a chance to record the message logs, and I currently find myself at work.  But here are some highlights that I remember:
<P>
The Culb will feature a daily 'Run Slide' joke.  A Run Slide joke is a one-liner that starts with the phrase "You run, you slide..." from the popular (?) crocodile slidy mat splash toy thing in the mid 90's.  I think Tausif made them all up.  In any case, they don't make sense, and there are more than 101 of them.
<P>
I guess that's the end of the promised list of "some highlights".  Maybe I'll remember more later.  The Culb seems to have a lot more potential than the DTC right now, maybe because we're more losers than jerks.  Well I am, and I think Ian is too.  I don't know about Tausif.  Maybe he's equally both.

<p>I think the back and forth useless hacking is probably going to stop very quickly once you run out of ideas. Unless it just becomes one of those "We OwN3 J00" type deals. Hmm, the fact that I'm signing this as TKO even though I've been reference by actual name several times already makes me deserving of a membership.</p>
<p>Oh well. With the tip of a hat and the flip of a pancake, we're off to sea!</p><P><I>-- TKO</I></FONT><P><CENTER>*   *   *   *   *</CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=Arial><FONT SIZE=3><B>ILA Material for the Culb</B></FONT><BR><B>February 26, 2003</B><BR><I>1:51 pm</I><P>The idea of the Loser Culb (I think it'll be "The Loser Culb" and not "The Losers Culb") came from the idea of expanding the patheticness of Imaginary Lovers Anonymous (<A HREF="http://ila.futuraretro.com">http://ila.futuraretro.com</A>) to outside the realm of romance.
<P>
It'll be a good idea to try to incorporate some of the material that we already have for the ILA into the Culb.  The ILA sections we can use are: Columns, Letter Box, and FAQ.  For everything else (About Us, Contacts, Join, Members, Partners,) we can make up our own for the Culb, as well as the DTC.
<P>
The meat of it all is in the columns.  We'll either have to list all the ILA articles under a designated 'romance' section, or we'll have to revise them to be more general.
<P>
We also need some kind of mascot/symbol and logo for both the Loser Culb and the Dirty Thief Club.  I'm not sure about using just a pathetic human for the Culb mascot is an innovative idea.  (Tausif suggested a kid selling lemonade in some kind of a southern accent.)<P><I>-- Janet</I></FONT><P><CENTER>*   *   *   *   *</CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=Arial><FONT SIZE=3><B>Hacked Pages & Schizophrenia</B></FONT><BR><B>February 26, 2003</B><BR><I>2:07 pm</I><P>About the hacked pages.  I don't think it'll be one of those "We OwN3 J00" cases.  The hacked pages will always be different and won't make sense, and it can be another 'running joke'.  I think we're gonna have a lot of running jokes that don't make sense.  Like when the DTC hacks the Culb, there might simply be a scanned picture of a certificate won by a Culb member for perfect attendance / punctuality in public school, with a heading "Culb Members are DORKS!  DTC oWn3 j00".
<P>
Or when the Culb hacks the DTC, there might be a picture of some washed-out woman with a headline claiming it's the mother of a DTC member, followed by "cULb oWn3 j00".  That can go at the end of every single hacked page heading.  Maybe while a site is 'hacked', the rest of the site won't be assessible.  That'd be interesting.
<P>
This can also be fun because it allows us to be extreme schizophrenics.  I mean, the DTC and the Culb are partners, but always at war and in competition.  Yet, all the members of the DTC are in the Culb.  And we'll be inventing war news.  It'll be like in George Orwell's <I>1984</I>, we'll have a news bulletin that tells of the current group we're at war with, and that the 5th 3-year-plan has just been taken into effect, so the ration of chocolate will be reduced to 2 grams a day.
<P>
A reminder that this is NOT a guestbook; it is a log that documents any (and i mean ANY) progress or development of the Culb and the DTC.  So no "wassup, cya l8er" type messages!<P><I>-- Janet</I></FONT><P><CENTER>*   *   *   *   *</CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=Arial><FONT SIZE=3><B>Losing interest</B></FONT><BR><B>February 27, 2003</B><BR><I>11:13 am</I><P><p>If not for work, I think I would have already lost interest. Oh well.</p>
<p>I've probably got a whopping 17.5 hours of class next term. Take away tutorials and all the stuff I won't go to, I'd say around 10 hours of class a week. This culb will likely just turn into a simple coop bitching session. Hmm, regsiter this as an offical UW club and then make it more popular than whatever coop-pub-whatever stuff there is already. The next logical step will be taking over the world. At that point the dirty thief club can take over operations and eventually destroy almost all of mankind. There will only be like 7 people left alive and then they can start a new chapter of the loser culb. Then this new 7 person loser culb will die off because they can't fend for themselves in the wild and, well, they're losers.</p><P><I>-- TKO</I></FONT><P><CENTER>*   *   *   *   *</CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=Arial><FONT SIZE=3><B>Ruin the surprise</B></FONT><BR><B>February 26, 2003</B><BR><I>3:44 pm</I><P><p>There should be like a grand opening type thing for the loser culb which inevitably gets ruined by the dirty thief club even though they both open on the same day and everyone already knew the dtc would do that.

<p>Hopefully, in about 9 weeks when I'm done work, I'll have better things to do than this.</p>

<p>Oh, by the way. Your barely done guestbook has another problem. If you accidentally go to the log_insert page because that autocompleted in your address bar, it adds a blank entry.

BECAUSE i used the same script, this means that the automatic-blank-entry problem will occur again.  So that's what the "if-method-equals-post" statement was for.

I like the surprise idea.  The problem would be that no one would be anticipating the surprise.  But it's a good idea.  We'll do that.

Also, right now on the main loserculb page, you'll see broken pics and weird floating red frames.  That's me trying to come up with a layout.  I'll make a logo and lettering later.  It will suck bad.  I hope someone will volunteer to do it.  Anyway, I'm wondering if the DTC and Culb should have the exact same layout?  Maybe.  Or maybe they'll be symmetrically reversed.  That'll be hard.  Maybe they'll just be the same layout with different colours.<P><I>-- Janet</I></FONT><P><CENTER>*   *   *   *   *</CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=Arial><FONT SIZE=3><B>To Do List</B></FONT><BR><B>March 3, 2003</B><BR><I>4:24 pm</I><P>I'm getting ready to leave work now.

<LI>Make some lettering.
<LI>Make some logos.

<LI>Ask Tausif if I can put up on the DTC site his Jamien-stealing-his-fries-at-that-crappy-sports-restaurant-in-Waterloo story.

I set up a subdirectory at <A HREF="http://dirtythief.futuraretro.com" target="_new">dirtythief.futuraretro.com</A>.  There's no index page so the full directory is viewable.  frame.php is the general layout.  subframe.php looks to be the sub-page layout.  (example: in an 'articles' section, the top menu would be the main menu and the lower menu would be the listings of all the articles.)
<P>
I will ask Tausif those things later tonight. Maybe, if I have the time.  Ian says that the reason he hasn't looked at the log and given me feedback on the Culb/DTC and forgot my birthday was because he has too much homework.  Tausif is in his program, so I guess that pretty much solidifies Ian's appointment to Executive Chairman of the Losers' Republic of the Culb, and me and Tausif demotion to mere comrades come this Summer.
<P>
It's good that nobody uses this log to post direct messages to someone else, because this is a development log, not a guestbook.

The Committee's boss has become insane, and that's not simply meaningless complain.  The boss is insane.  Most probably because the boss, already a nervous one, is even more nervous because a star employee is threatening to quit.  Also, the Committee caused the boss to get into a dispute with another pretty employee.
<P>
The Committee hates its paid job.  However, instead of pretending to do it, as the Committee has been doing for a few months now, the decision was made to work as hard as it can to finish the work, so the Committee can witness the boss nervously think of more work.
<P>
Thus, besides the 'logo' on the DTC page, perhaps not much progress has been made in the Culb/DTC, which one may start referring to as "The Republic" or "Le Républic".  However, tomorrow the Committee needs not go downtown to work, so more stuff might get done.
