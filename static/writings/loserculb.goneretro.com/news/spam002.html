Dear Pending Comrades: 
<P>
Since most of you have so graciously ignored my previous plea for attention, I am now sending you a personal invitation to be a member of the Loser Culb. 
<P>
You can find the main site at: 
<BR><A HREF="http://loserculb.futuraretro.com/">http://loserculb.futuraretro.com/</A>
<P>
If you would like to be a member, send me the alias you wish to be represented by, as well as a description.  If you give me no reply, I will probably add your name and make up my own description for you. 
<P>
So far, there are only four names listed.  These four are the permanent Culb Security Council veto holders, and represent: Anjo, Ian, Janet, TKO.  If you just read your name, that means your description is already up and if you don't like it, then tell me.  If I get no reply from you, I will assume you are happy with your new position and proceed to sign you up for many other things. 
<P>
We will take as long as it takes to win this war. 
<P>
Militarily Yours, 
<BR>Comrade Janet
