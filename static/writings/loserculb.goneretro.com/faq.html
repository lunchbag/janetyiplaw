<strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong> 
<P>


<B>What's the Loser Culb all about? </B>
<BR>We are a group of people who have banded together to defeat our mutual loserness. Alphabetically, we're gonna stop being the bums, clods, dorks, geeks, jinxes, klutzes, loners, nerds, outcasts, programmers, queers, rednecks, suckers, wimps, and xylophones that we are.
<P>
<B>Why is it spelled "Loser Culb"?</B>
<BR>Originally, it was going to be "Loser Club".  But then someone made a typo and spelled "Loser Culb" instead and we didn't know what to do about it so we left it.
<P>
<B>What's that ugly rectangle beside the title?</B>
<BR>We had come up with a really great logo for the Culb.  It was kind of like Hitler's swastika, but not as evil and definitely much prettier.  Unfortunately, someone messed up on it.  The computer didn't recognize the symbol and so produced the default rectangle.  We didn't know what to do about it so we left it.
<P>
<B>Who maintains the Loser Culb website? </B>
<BR>Janet maintains it. TKO sometimes writes stuff in the logs.  Ian complains that he has too much homework. Anjo pretends that he didn't get any messages.

<P>
<B>Can I still be a member if I'm not a loser?</B>
<BR>You can't be a member if you're not truthful.

<P>
<B>Why do you refer to yourself as 'we'? </B>
<BR>It makes us sound more like a legitimate group, unlike those other hack groups, (the one that comes to mind is the NRA for some reason.)
<P>
<B>Hey Janet, why the hell did you list me as a member? I don't remember joining.</B>
<BR>Of course you did, silly.

<P>

<P>
<B>What's your favourite colour? </B>
<BR>Before, when I was really superstitious and religious, I thought that blue and white were the colors of heaven, while red and black were the colours of hell. I told myself that my favourite colour was blue, and eventually it was so, even though I hated the way blue looked on me and everything around me. But then one day, I realized my foolishness, and that heaven and hell are state of minds and regardless of anything, a favourite colour does not imply goodness or evil. After eventual changes in style and taste, I now find all my clothing in various shades of red, my current favourite colour.

<P>
<B>I bet no one actually asked any 'frequently asked questions' and you're just pretending that you got all these emails.</B>
<BR>That's correct. I'm making all this up while I'm sitting here at work waiting for the day to end.
