<font SIZE="2">
<p>Thought it was a great idea<br />
When I saw that bucket on the ground.<br />
Thought it'd sit well<br />
on my lovely little head.<br />
<br />
I put it on my head<br />
But now I can't get it off.<br />
It's stuck on my head.<br />
I've got this bucket stuck on my head.<br />
<br />
I'm tugging and pulling<br />
at my poor aching head.<br />
The pain begins to throb.<br />
The panic starts to rush.<br />
<br />
What if I can't get it off?<br />
How will I wear a hat?<br />
I'm running around screaming<br />
With this bucket on my head.<br />
<br />
Goddamnit!<br />
Get this bucket off my head!<br />
I'm freaking out here!<br />
I can't get this fucking thing off my head!<br />
I just can't get you off of my head!<br />
Can't get you off of my head!
