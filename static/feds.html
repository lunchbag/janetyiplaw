  <pre>For Immediate Release:

The Federation of Students Remembers Janet Yip


Waterloo:	The Federation of Students today sends its condolences to the
family of Janet Yip, 2006-2007 Engineering Councillor, who passed away in
Kingston on Wednesday November 29th after a short battle with acute
leukemia.
	Janet had joined the Federation's Students' Council for a second term in
office this year after serving as a Councillor for the Engineering
constituency in 2005-2006, and was a valued member of the Internal
Administration and Internal Funding Committees.  She played an instrumental
part in the running of the children's stage at this year's Canada Day
celebration at Columbia Lake.  Janet was also an active member of the
Waterloo Public Interest Research Group (WPIRG) and had founded a peace
activist group on campus.
'The Federation of Students will greatly miss Janet,' says Federation of
Students President Michelle Zakrison.  'She was a dedicated Councillor with
whom I had the pleasure of working with for two years.  She brought humour
to Council meetings and represented Engineering students well.'
'Janet believed in the Federation and devoted herself to public service,'
says Vice-President, Internal Sai Kit Lo.
The members of Students' Council will remember Janet at their meeting on
Sunday, December 3, 2006 in the SLC multipurpose room. The memorial will
start at 11:30am and the Council meeting will begin at 12:30pm.  The
Federation of Students will also be collecting donations at this time and at
the front desk in the Federation of Students office (SLC 1102) to help her
family with the unexpected financial burden of the situation.
